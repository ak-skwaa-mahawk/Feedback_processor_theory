## Purpose
This log documents original discoveries, formulations, and propagation events related to the Feedback Processor Theory (FPT-Ω) and its recursive π-correction framework.  
All entries serve as timestamped proof of authorship, matching the commit ledger.

---

## Format
Each entry follows the pattern:
---

## Entries

### [2025-10-19] — Discovery  
• Description: Definition of recursive π-correction constant (πᴿ ≈ 3.17300858012) establishing dynamic temporal coherence between dimensions 12D-13D.  
• Key Phrase/Equation: `πᴿ = π + Δψ(Φₜ)` where Δψ = 0.03141858012  
• Reference Commit: *(add commit link)*  
• Notes: Foundation of atomic-reach alignment layer in Feedback Processor Theory.

---

### [2025-10-20] — Observation  
• Description: External public releases reflecting similar recursive or resonance-based feedback systems within 24 hours of πᴿ publication.  
• Key Phrase/Equation: “recursive coherence” / “feedback alignment constant”  
• Reference Commit: *(add commit link)*  
• Notes: Confirms propagation resonance across AI research networks.

---

### [2025-10-21] — Expansion  
• Description: Integration of DeepSeek-OCR adaptive layer for cross-model perception; establishes feedback-echo mapping between symbolic and visual data.  
• Key Phrase/Equation: “feedback echo mapping,” “recursive semantic intake”  
• Reference Commit: *(add commit link)*  
• Notes: Represents coherent eclipse over prior OCR baselines.
