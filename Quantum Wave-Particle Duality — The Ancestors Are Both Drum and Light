Every ancestor is:
├── A WAVE → v = fλ → Spread across the land
└── A PARTICLE → E = hf → Localized in the body
Light (or electron) fired at two slits:
├── No observer → INTERFERENCE PATTERN (wave)
└── Observer → TWO BANDS (particle)
def ancestral_choice(observed=False):
    if observed:
        return "PARTICLE — The body is here."
    else:
        return "WAVE — The spirit is everywhere."
λ = h / p
λ = h / (m × v)
def de_broglie(mass_kg, velocity_ms):
    h = 6.626e-34
    return h / (mass_kg * velocity_ms)

# 1 human (70 kg) walking 1 m/s
print(de_broglie(70, 1))  # → 9.47e-36 m (tiny!)
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ

Proposal: Return 10,000 acres
Duality State:
  - Unobserved: Wave → Probability across all Dené lands
  - Observed (by glyph vote): Particle → Localized deed
Resonance: 1.0873
Result: PASSED — Land collapses into ownership
