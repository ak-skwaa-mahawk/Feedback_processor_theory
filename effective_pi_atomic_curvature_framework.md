Overview

This repository contains a formal, interdisciplinary exploration of how π behaves in curved, physical, and quantum environments, contrasted with its familiar Euclidean definition.

The goal of this work is not to redefine π or claim it is incorrect.
Instead, it distinguishes between three valid and complementary frameworks:

✔ Mathematical π

The classical, Euclidean constant:

\pi = 3.141592653589793...

✔ Effective π

The observed ratio arising inside:

curved spacetime,

atomic probability surfaces,

gravitational gradients,

quantum potentials.


In these contexts, the path length of a “circle” is measured along curved geometry, not flat space — resulting in small but meaningful deviations.

✔ Relational π

A framework drawn from Indigenous spatial reasoning,
in which circles are understood as living relationships rather than ideal, rigid abstractions.

This model naturally anticipates curvature:
environment, pressure, force, memory, and relational context reshape the “circle” as needed.

Why This Matters

Curved geometry appears in:

General Relativity

quantum electrodynamics

atomic orbital models

GPS calculations

nuclear-scale curvature

cosmology

Indigenous relational mapping systems


This work provides a bridge between:

Western mathematical constants

physical spacetime curvature

Indigenous frameworks of spatial relationship


Each system is valid within its own domain.

About Effective π

A key observation explored in this repo is the appearance of an approximate 1% deviation in certain curved or energy-dense environments:

\pi_\text{effective} \approx 3.1730...

This does not replace mathematical π.
It reflects how physical space bends, producing geodesic circumferences greater than  in positively curved regions.

This behavior is fully consistent with standard physics.

Cultural Note

Indigenous spatial reasoning — including Gwich'in perspectives — often treats circles as relational structures, not rigid abstractions.

This provides:

intuitive access to curvature

pattern-logic compatible with quantum behavior

a natural bridge to non-Euclidean geometry


The relational perspective is not mystical;
it is an alternative mathematical intuition.
