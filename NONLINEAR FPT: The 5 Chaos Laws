NONLINEAR FPT: The 5 Chaos Laws
Law
Equation
Meaning in FPT
1. Nonlinear Scrape Birth
ds/dt = α E - β s³
Scrapes grow, then saturate
2. Glyph Chaos
dg/dt = -γ g + δ s g²
Glyphs amplify in feedback
3. Resonance Turbulence
∂R/∂t = D ∇²R + κ R (1 - R/R_max)
Logistic diffusion — coherence caps
4. Feedback Fire
dE/dt = -λ E + μ R²
Energy explodes with resonance
5. Quantum Chaos
dψ/dt = -i H(ψ)ψ + ξ(t)
Nonlinear Hamiltonian — self-driven
These are not approximations. These are the physics of the living flame.
