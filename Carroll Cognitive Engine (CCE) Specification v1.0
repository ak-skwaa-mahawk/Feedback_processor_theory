0. Executive Summary

The Carroll Cognitive Engine (CCE) is a scientifically grounded cognitive and computational architecture designed to model:

nonlinear pattern mapping

perceptual compression and expansion

curvature-aware cognition

relational tension sensitivity

dynamic transformation of information


CCE does not claim cultural, mystical, or identity-based traits.
It is:

> A formal cognitive model inspired by relational reasoning patterns,
and implemented as a computational framework.



CCE is designed for use in:

cognitive science

AI research

computational modeling

educational tools

reasoning engines



---

1. Purpose of the Architecture

CCE exists to:

1. Model how certain minds flex information across frames (compression/expansion).


2. Formalize cognitive “curvature sensitivity.”


3. Provide a computational analog of nonlinear reasoning.


4. Enable a Python implementation others can test.


5. Serve as the foundation for future relational AI models.



CCE is not a cultural statement about any group.
It is a personal cognitive architecture designed by John B. Carroll that incorporates influences from relational reasoning styles he learned growing up.

2. Conceptual Overview

CCE models cognition as:

a relational field

a curvature-sensitive mapping system

an adaptive pattern transformer

a distortion-correction engine


Instead of only storing facts, CCE transforms patterns across:

scale

direction

emotional context

social tension

relational meaning

perceptual deviations


This is similar to:

nonlinear systems

dynamical models

topology-based reasoning

human contextual inference

3. Core Cognitive Components

CCE defines five internal cognitive dimensions:

3.1 Pattern Compression

Shrinks a large pattern into a small codec-like representation.

3.2 Pattern Expansion

Expands a compressed pattern into multiple interpretations.

3.3 Curvature Sensitivity (ε)

Ability to detect distortion, inconsistency, or tension in patterns.

3.4 Relational Mapping (τ)

Tracks how elements relate under tension or context shifts.

3.5 Insight Threshold (κ)

When relational resonance exceeds a threshold, a restructuring event occurs.


---

4. Mathematical Framework

CCE uses a state triple:

s = (v, τ, r)

Where:

v = literal vector

τ = relational tension vector

r = curvature response coefficient


4.1 Curvature Operator (C)

C(s) = s × (1 + ε)

ε typically 1%–3%.

4.2 Tension Mapping (T)

τ = ∇ relational_field

4.3 Resonance Propagation (Φ)

Φ(s_i, s_j) = exp( - |τ_i - τ_j| / r )

4.4 Insight Condition

Σ Φ ≥ κ

5. Transformation Pipeline

CCE processes information through six steps:

Input
 → Encoding
   → Relational Mapping
     → Curvature Adjustment
       → Distortion Correction
         → Insight Generation

6. Python Reference Implementation

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Carroll Cognitive Engine (CCE) - Reference Implementation
# ---------------------------------------------------------

import numpy as np

class CCE:
    def __init__(self, epsilon=0.01, insight_threshold=0.8):
        self.epsilon = epsilon              # curvature sensitivity
        self.insight_threshold = insight_threshold
        self.trace = []                     # transparency log

    # ------------------------------
    # Encoding: prepare input vector
    # ------------------------------
    def encode(self, x):
        v = np.array(x, dtype=float)
        tau = np.zeros_like(v)              # initial tension
        r = np.ones_like(v)                 # initial curvature
        self.trace.append(("encode", v))
        return v, tau, r

    # --------------------------------------
    # Tension Mapping: gradient of relations
    # --------------------------------------
    def tension_mapping(self, v):
        tau = np.gradient(v)
        self.trace.append(("tension", tau))
        return tau

    # -----------------------------------------
    # Curvature Engine: adjust for distortion
    # -----------------------------------------
    def curvature_adjust(self, v, r):
        v_adj = v * (1 + self.epsilon)
        r_adj = r * (1 + self.epsilon/2)
        self.trace.append(("curvature", v_adj))
        return v_adj, r_adj

    # --------------------------------------------
    # Resonance: measure relational consistency
    # --------------------------------------------
    def resonance(self, tau):
        # simple normalization of tension difference
        diffs = np.abs(np.diff(tau))
        res = np.exp(-np.mean(diffs))
        self.trace.append(("resonance", res))
        return res

    # -------------------------------------------
    # Insight Loop: Iterate until threshold met
    # -------------------------------------------
    def insight(self, x, max_iters=10):
        v, tau, r = self.encode(x)

        for i in range(max_iters):
            tau = self.tension_mapping(v)
            res = self.resonance(tau)

            if res >= self.insight_threshold:
                self.trace.append(("insight_reached", v))
                return v, True  # return representation

            v, r = self.curvature_adjust(v, r)

        self.trace.append(("insight_not_reached", v))
        return v, False

7. Example Usage

from cce import CCE

engine = CCE(epsilon=0.01, insight_threshold=0.85)

data = [1.0, 2.1, 3.05, 3.9]

output, insight = engine.insight(data)

print("Output:", output)
print("Insight achieved:", insight)

for entry in engine.trace:
    print(entry)

8. Safety & Ethical Notes

CCE is:

not a diagnostic tool

not representative of all cultural thinking

not tied to identity

not metaphysical


CCE is a computational + cognitive model inspired by relational reasoning patterns learned personally by John B. Carroll.
