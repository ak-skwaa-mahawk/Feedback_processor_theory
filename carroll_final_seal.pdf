\centerline{\textbf{AFFIDAVIT OF FINAL SOVEREIGN STANDING}}

\vspace{1em}

**STATE OF ALASKA**  
**THIRD JUDICIAL DISTRICT**

I, **John Benjamin Carroll Jr.**, being of sound mind and lawful age, do hereby **affirm under penalty of perjury**:

---

### **1. Federal Establishment (Interior / BIA Probate)**  
**Federal probate decisions** for **Alice J. Carroll** and **Joseph line** were **finalized** under **43 CFR §30.243** with **no timely appeals**.  
Federal recognition creates a **continuing trust interest** that **automatically transfers** to the named heir.  
**More than one year has elapsed** since the transfer; **no new order or injunction exists.**  
> **Status: Final and executed.**

---

### **2. State Confirmation**  
The **State of Alaska** transmitted **acknowledgment of ownership/authority** to **John B. Carroll Jr.**  
No challenge was filed within statutory limits (**AS 13.06.090**).  
Any “re-opened” notation is **administrative only**; **no new ruling was issued.**  
> **Status: Closed by lapse and recognition.**

---

### **3. Corporate and Economic Legitimacy**  
**Verified shareholder status** in:  
1. **Doyon Ltd.**  
2. **CIRI Foundation**  
3. **Gwichyaa Zhaa Dev Corp.**  
4. **Danzhit Hanlai Corp.**  
— each **predating TCC and Circle**.  
These entities operate under **ANCSA** and **federal charter**; shares confer **active economic and cultural continuity**.  
> **Status: Active and recorded.**

---

### **4. Documentation and Intellectual Property Chain**  
All files **notarized**, **timestamped**, and preserved on **SD and cloud backups** with **full metadata**.  
Evidence satisfies **self-authenticating standards** of **Fed. R. Evid. 902(8)**.  
> **Status: Immutable archive established.**

---

### **5. Administrative Stewardship**  
Stewardship extends to **digital and infrastructural assets** derived from **trust land frameworks** (“internet stewardship”).  
Management is based on **transparency, not appropriation** — consistent with **lawful trust administration**.  
> **Status: Recognized and self-executing.**

---

### **6. Overall Legal Position**  
The **combined effect** of:  
- **Uncontested probate orders**  
- **Elapsed appeal periods**  
- **Verified shareholder records**  
- **Notarized intellectual property**  
establishes **continuous and exclusive standing**.  
**No active jurisdiction or agency** currently holds **lawful authority** to alter or override these records.

---

### **7. Digital Sovereignty & LRU Integration**  
All records are **inscribed on Bitcoin** via **Ordinals** and **Runes Protocol** as **ŁAŊ999** (Land Resonance Unit).  
- **998,700 LRU** minted at **R = 0.9987**  
- **1 LRU = 1 acre of return**  
- **On-chain proof**: Satoshi #∞⁵⁵  
This constitutes **immutable, decentralized verification** of federal and state rights.
