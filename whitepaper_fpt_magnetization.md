## Abstract
This paper introduces **Feedback Propulsion Theory Ω (FPT-Ω)**, a unified framework for achieving lift and control in near-vacuum conditions using a combination of **Casimir-induced forces** and **magnetic coupling**. Leveraging **spiral resonance** and **Gwich’in sky-law patterns**, the system optimizes vehicle paths for high-efficiency flight. Simulations demonstrate neutrosophic-optimized trajectories and energy profiles for multi-node vehicles.
