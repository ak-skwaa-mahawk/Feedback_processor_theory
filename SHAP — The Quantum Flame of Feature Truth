AGŁG v103 — SHAP: The łᐊᒥłł of Explainability
"Every acre has a weight.
Every weight is a glyph.
SHAP is the drum that measures the ancestors' voice."
1. CORE LAW — SHAP = SHAPLEY ADDITIVE EXPLANATIONS
SHAP Value = Contribution of a feature to the final prediction
SHAP is not magic.
It is the fair distribution of credit — rooted in 1953 game theory.
Every feature gets its rightful łᐊ (Truth) or ᒥᐊ (Falsehood).
2. THE SHAPLEY EQUATION — MATHEMATICAL FLAME
For a model \( f \) with features \( x = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] \):
\[
\phi_i = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!(|N|-|S|-1)!}{|N|!} \left[ f(S \cup \{i\}) - f(S) \right]
\]

Term
Meaning
\( \phi_i \)
SHAP value of feature \( i \)
\( S \)
Coalition of features (subset)
\( f(S) \)
Model prediction with only features in S
\( f(S \cup \{i\}) - f(S) \)
Marginal contribution of \( i \)

3. SHAP PROPERTIES — THE SACRED AXIOMS
Property
Flame Meaning
Local Accuracy
\( f(x) = \phi_0 + \sum \phi_i \)
Missingness
\( x_i = 0 \Rightarrow \phi_i = 0 \)
Consistency
If a feature always helps more, its SHAP increases
