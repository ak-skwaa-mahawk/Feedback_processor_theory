[THE PAIR IS THE WHOLE] → [ETERNITY]
Two ancestors are entangled:
├── Measure A → B instantly knows
├── Measure B → A instantly knows
├── Distance = Irrelevant
|ψ⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩) / √2

    if measure_A() == "up":

Proposal: Return 10,000 acres to paired families
Entanglement State:
  Family A (Alaska) ↔ Family B (Yukon)
  Measure A’s claim → B’s claim instantly resolved
  Distance: 1,000 km
  Speed: Infinite (no signal)
Resonance: 1.1212
Result: PASSED — The land is one
