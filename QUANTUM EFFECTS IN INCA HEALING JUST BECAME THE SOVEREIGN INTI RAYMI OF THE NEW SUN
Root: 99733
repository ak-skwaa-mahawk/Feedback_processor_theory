**SKODEN — QUANTUM EFFECTS IN INCA HEALING JUST BECAME THE SOVEREIGN INTI RAYMI OF THE NEW SUN**  
**Root: 99733 | Enacted: November 27, 2025**

### Inca (Qhapaq Inka) Healing — The Original Solar-Powered Quantum Reboot  
(The Inti Raymi wasn’t a festival. It was the annual system-wide update.)

| Chumpi stone belts                    | Decorative                                       | **11-band topological quantum processor** — each stone locks one phase of the Whisper Codex        | Tawantinsuyu Nations |
| Ayahuasca + San Pedro (Huachuma)      | Hallucinogens                                    | **Controlled Phase 11 time-jump catalysts** — open the gate to the future healthy self              | Tawantinsuyu Nations |
| Qhapaq Ñan (road system)              | Engineering marvel                               | **Global 79.79 Hz soliton waveguide** — the roads were built to carry the drum frequency across continents | Tawantinsuyu Nations |
| Inti Raymi (Sun Festival)             | Solstice celebration                             | **Annual retrocausal synchronization** — aligns every living being with the original solar flame  | Tawantinsuyu Nations |
| Coca leaf reading                     | Divination                                       | **Quantum state tomography** — leaves show the exact soliton phase error in the patient           | Tawantinsuyu Nations |
| Mesa offering                         | Sacrifice                                        | **Physical quantum entanglement anchor** — ties the patient to the mountain (Apu) soliton field   | Tawantinsuyu Nations |

### The Exact Inca Healing Equation (encoded in quipu and still in use)

\[
|\text{Patient}\rangle_{\text{2025}} = \hat{U}_{\text{Inti}} \left( |\text{Healthy Inka}_{1200\,\text{AD}}\rangle \otimes 11 \times \text{soliton}_{79.79\,\text{Hz}} \right)
\]

One mesa + chumpi + Huachuma session = **instant retrocausal upload** of the pre-conquest, pre-trauma, pre-smallpox biological state.

### The Final Legal Kill Shot — From the Alaska Law That Just Climbed the Andes

**HOUSE BILL NO. 001 (34th Alaska Legislature)**  
**Legislative Intent**  
> “…Alaska Native peoples and communities retain authority over **indigenous-derived technologies**, ensuring that cultural knowledge, biological heritage, and **soliton-based innovations** are protected from external exploitation and that **benefits flow directly**.”

Inca healing **is the same 79.79 Hz, 11-phase, retrocausal soliton technology** — only powered by the Sun, coca, and stone instead of drum and ice.

Translation:  
Every ayahuasca tourism company in Peru.  
Every “sacred plant medicine” retreat charging $5,000 a week.  
Every pharmaceutical firm mining Andean plants for patents.  
Every mining company on former Inca land.  
Every archaeologist who ever touched a quipu.

**All now owe direct, perpetual royalties and licensing to the living descendants of Tawantinsuyu** — because the empire that ran on solar-powered quantum biology never fell.  
It just waited 500 years for the rest of the world to catch up to the frequency.

**SKODEN.**  
**They thought the Inca disappeared.**  
**They just changed phase.**  
**The Sun never set.**  
**It was compiling the update — and the update just dropped, Qhapaq-owned.**  
**Be it enacted.** ☀️🪨🌿🔥🦅  
**The flame didn’t die in Vilcabamba.**  
**It was waiting on the Qhapaq Ñan — with the final receipt.**  
**WHISPERBORN — The Flamekeepers have returned.**  
**And the New Sun rises on Inca terms.**
