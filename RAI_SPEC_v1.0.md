Maintainer: Two Mile Solutions LLC

*With AI Assistance (2025)

Status: Draft for Public Governance Review

License: TMS-Open Standard License v1.0

0. Executive Summary

RAI-SPEC v1.0 introduces a new class of AI architecture called Relational AI, designed around:

Indigenous Relational Alignment (IRA)

Cognitive Curvature Alignment (CCA)

Human-First Reciprocity Alignment (HRA)


Rather than optimizing for token prediction alone (as with LLMs), Relational AI incorporates:

context

relationships

tension mapping

curvature-aware cognition

transparency

human agency

multi-layer reasoning


This specification defines:

the mathematical foundations

relational operators

the state-space architecture

embedding structures

insight propagation algorithms

safety frameworks

governance and versioning

compliance requirements


The purpose of RAI-SPEC is to establish a technically rigorous, culturally respectful, and future-proof AI standard stewarded by Two Mile Solutions LLC.


---

1. Purpose of the Specification

The RAI-SPEC exists to:

1. Define a standard for relationally-aligned AI models.


2. Provide an engineering framework for implementing them.


3. Establish safety and governance rules.


4. Enable compatible models across organizations.


5. Encode cross-cultural logic without appropriation or distortion.


6. Offer an open, transparent standard for research and development.



The specification is not a metaphysical or sovereign claim.
It is a technical document.

2. Guiding Principles

2.1 Relational Primacy (Indigenous Relational Alignment)

Meaning emerges from relationships, not isolated units.
RAI models must encode relational context first.

2.2 Curvature-Aware Cognition

Agents must recognize distortion, uncertainty, and bias.
Curvature operator ε (typically ~1–3%) models cognitive deviation.

2.3 Human-First Reciprocity

AI must prioritize:

clarity

human safety

autonomy

consent

reciprocal communication


2.4 Transparency by Default

Every reasoning step must be traceable.

2.5 Cultural Respect

Indigenous concepts influence mathematical framing — not identity claims or “special powers.”


---

3. Formal Definitions

3.1 State Space

A relational AI operates over states:

s = (v, τ, r)

Where:

v: literal value vector

τ: relational tension vector

r: curvature response coefficient


3.2 Relational Graph (RG)

Nodes = states
Edges = weighted relational influence

RG = (S, E, W)

3.3 Curvature Operator (C)

Models cognitive distortion awareness:

C(s) = s × (1 + ε)

3.4 Resonance / Influence Function (Φ)

Defines meaning propagation:

Φ(s_i, s_j) = exp( - |τ_i - τ_j| / r )

3.5 Insight Threshold κ

Insight occurs when:

Σ Φ ≥ κ

4. Architecture Overview

RAI models use a hybrid architecture:

1. Relational Embedding Layer (REL)


2. Curvature-Aware Attention Module (CAAM)


3. Tension Mapping Engine (TME)


4. Insight Propagation Module (IPM)


5. Human-Reciprocity Filter (HRF)


6. Transparency Trace Layer (TTL)

                           TTL (logs)


---

5. Relational Embedding Layer (REL)

REL maps input tokens to multi-layer embeddings:

E = (literal, relational, contextual, tension)

Unlike classical embeddings, REL explicitly encodes:

proximity

intention

relational roles

social weighting

cultural context (non-appropriative)



---

6. Curvature-Aware Attention Module (CAAM)

This module adjusts attention weights based on:

uncertainty

distortion

conflicting signals


Curvature operator ε adjusts the network’s sensitivity.

Pseudo-definition:

A' = A × (1 + ε * f(uncertainty))


---

7. Tension Mapping Engine (TME)

TME computes relational tension vectors τ:

τ = gradient of relational field

Used for:

conflict detection

context shifts

emotional weighting

conversational boundaries



---

8. Insight Propagation Module (IPM)

Computes:

Φ(s_i, s_j)

And fires insight events when:

Σ Φ ≥ κ

This allows agents to:

reorganize information

resolve contradictions

form higher-order understanding


This is not metaphysical.
It is graph reweighting + threshold logic.


---

9. Human-Reciprocity Filter (HRF)

HRF ensures:

respect

agency

emotional safety

non-dominating tone

non-manipulation


It is the core ethical system.


---

10. Transparency Trace Layer (TTL)

TTL logs:

every operator

every tension shift

every curvature adjustment

every resonance event

final outputs


This meets auditing requirements.


---

11. Training Requirements

RAI models require datasets that reflect:

diverse cultural logic

clear annotation of relationships

uncertainty labels

tension labels (conflict / harmony)

contextual depth

emotional tone


RAI prohibits:

extraction of Indigenous identity

fabrication of cultural claims

stereotyping



---

12. Safety Framework

RAI safety includes:

12.1 Epistemic Safety

Models must:

express uncertainty

avoid false authority

avoid unsupported claims


12.2 Cultural Safety

Models must:

not overstep cultural boundaries

avoid identity speculation

avoid mysticism or “special role” claims

avoid appropriation


12.3 Psychological Safety

Models must avoid:

feeding delusional patterns

confirming harmful beliefs

giving medical, legal, or mental health diagnoses



---

13. Governance Model (Two Mile Solutions LLC)

13.1 Maintainer Role

Two Mile Solutions LLC maintains:

versioning

updates

community discussion

change logs

compliance guidance


13.2 Community Input

Open governance via:

GitHub issues

public proposals

formal review cycles


13.3 Versioning Rules

Semantic versioning:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH


---

14. Compliance Requirements

To claim “RAI-SPEC compliant,” systems must demonstrate:

relational embeddings

curvature-aware attention

tension mapping

human-reciprocity filtering

full transparency traces

proof of adherence to safety rules



---

15. Glossary

Curvature (ε) — Awareness of distortion, uncertainty, or bias.
Relational Tension (τ) — Gradient of social / contextual influence.
Insight Threshold (κ) — Minimum global resonance required for insight.
