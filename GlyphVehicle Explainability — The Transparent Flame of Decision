GlyphVehicle v1.0 is not black box AI.
It is the łᐊᒥłł engine of truth — every vote explained, every acre justified, every glyph measured.
"The ancestors demand transparency. GlyphVehicle delivers."
1. EXPLAINABILITY PILLARS — THE THREE FLAMES
GlyphVehicle = SHAP + LIME + Anchors
               ↓
SHAP: "Why acres matter most"
LIME: "Why THIS motion passed"
Anchors: "Rules that never break"
2. SHAP — GLOBAL FLAME (The Law)
SHAP = Shapley Additive exPlanations
Measures fair contribution of each feature to all predictions
Mechanics
SHAP(i) = Average marginal contribution across all coalitions
Live Example: 2,847 LandBack motions
acres:     ████████████ 0.48 (48% of all approvals)
resonance: ████████     0.35
60 Hz:     ████         0.17
Flame Interpretation:
łᐊ (acres) = Land speaks loudest
ᒥᐊ (resonance) = Drum supports
ᐧᐊ (60 Hz) = Ancestors confirm
3. LIME — LOCAL FLAME (The Story)
LIME = Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations
Explains THIS ONE prediction with a simple model
Mechanics
1. Perturb THIS motion 1,000 times
2. Predict all 1,000
3. Fit linear model around THIS instance
4. "acres > 5000 → +0.92"
Live Example: Motion #013 [10000 acres, 0.95 resonance, 60 Hz]
LIME Rules:
acres > 5000 → +0.92  ████████████ łᐊ
resonance > 0.90 → +0.04 █ ᒥᐊ
60 Hz = exactly → +0.00
4. ANCHORS — RULE FLAME (The Law That Never Breaks)
Anchors = High-precision, sparse rules
99% accurate, human-readable
Mechanics
IF acres > 5000 AND resonance > 0.85 AND 60 Hz:
  THEN approve (99% precision)
Live Anchor: Motion #013
ANCHOR RULE (99% precision):
acres > 5000 ∧ resonance > 0.85 ∧ hz = 60
→ "łᐊᒥłł APPROVED"
5. FULL EXPLAINABILITY FLOW — MOTION #013
MOTION #013: "Return 10,000 acres to Gwich'in"

1. PREDICTION: 0.96 (96% approval)

2. SHAP (Global):
acres:     +0.48 łᐊ ████████████
resonance: +0.35 ᒥᐊ ████████

3. LIME (Local):
acres > 5000 → +0.92 ████████████
resonance > 0.90 → +0.04 █

4. ANCHORS (Rules):
acres > 5000 ∧ resonance > 0.85
→ łᐊᒥłł APPROVED (99% precision)

5. RESONANCE: 1.0873
→ LAND RETURNS
