Two Mile Solutions LLC — Authenticity & Stewardship Notice

IACA authenticity: We market creative works, protocols, seals, and artifacts with accurate, non-misleading lineage and authorship. Any use of tribal names/affiliations or “Native/Indian” descriptors reflects factual authorship or certified artisan status; otherwise we use clear, non-misleading descriptors. Violations of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act can carry up to $250,000 and 5 years for individuals, $1,000,000 for businesses. 

Space/“satellite land” stewardship (not appropriation): We practice stewardship of orbital/satellite-derived data and signals. We do not claim ownership of outer space or celestial bodies; the Outer Space Treaty bars national appropriation “by claim of sovereignty… or any other means.” Our work is data guardianship, licensing, and compliance, not territorial claims. 

U.S. licensing posture: When operating or partnering on systems that transmit/receive, we follow:

FCC Part 25 streamlined small-sat process (or Part 5/97 where appropriate) for radio licensing. 

NOAA CRSRA remote sensing licensing where we operate U.S. private Earth imaging systems or distribute such data. Recent rule reforms reduced temporary limits on commercial systems, esp. SAR. 


Provenance & access: All releases carry Flame signatures, capability tokens (time-bound, revocable, delegable), and optional resonance-gated scopes to prevent misuse while enabling research access (summary → consented → full).

Reporting: Suspected IACA misrepresentation or misuse of our marks can be reported to us and to the Indian Arts and Crafts Board for investigation and referral.

3) Enforcement “We’re Not Playing” Notice (paste as /legal/enforcement-notice.txt & in your repo SECURITY.md)

Enforcement & Misrepresentation Notice

Unauthorized parties mislabeling or suggesting our works are “Indian/Native/Tribal” without factual basis, or passing off our seals as their own, may trigger civil/criminal remedies under IACA (18 U.S.C. §1159) and related laws. We preserve complete provenance (hashes, seals, QR receipts). Market or gallery representations that misuse tribal names or imply Native origin where false are prosecutable. Recent federal cases show active enforcement.

4) Operating Guardrails for “Satellites = Stewardship” (paste as /space/operating-guardrails.md)

1. Non-appropriation: No language implying territorial claims in space. Use “steward/guardian of datasets and signal chains,” not “owner of orbital lanes/territory.” 


2. Licensing plan:

If we transmit/receive: file FCC (Part 25 streamlined small-sat criteria; or Part 5 experimental; Part 97 amateur, as applicable). 

If we image/operate sensors: NOAA CRSRA license for remote sensing; account for tiered conditions (many SAR limits recently removed). 



3. Data policy: All released imagery/telemetry carries capability tokens (TTL, scope, revocation).


4. Exports: Screen partners/algorithms for ITAR/EAR exposure (document in a checklist; not a claim, just process).


5. Public claims: Use “public benefit stewardship / cultural continuity research” phrasing; never suggest sovereignty over space assets.
