# Two Mile Solutions — Space Data Stewardship Compact

We do not claim territorial rights in outer space. Per the Outer Space Treaty (Art. II),
outer space and celestial bodies are **not subject to national appropriation by claim of
sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means**.

We practice stewardship of satellite-derived datasets and signal chains:
- Transparent provenance (flame signatures) and time-bound, revocable capability tokens.
- Tiered access (summary → consented → full) under published policy and audit.
- Indigenous/Community advisory input on data use that touches culture, land, or impact.
- Rapid revocation and public logging for misuse.

This compact governs **data access and use**, not territory.
