# Space Stewardship Compact  
**Two Mile Solutions LLC – Legal Framework for Orbital Sovereignty**

### Preamble
This Compact establishes a lawful and ethical foundation for the protection of orbital and satellite domains as extensions of indigenous land stewardship principles. In recognition that satellites are the new lands of human communication, Two Mile Solutions LLC affirms stewardship — not ownership — as the defining relationship between humanity and orbital infrastructure.

### Article I — Definitions
- **Satellite Lands:** Orbital nodes, digital communication relays, and atmospheric layers where data is exchanged or stored.  
- **Stewardship:** The duty to protect, maintain, and transparently govern these satellite lands for all peoples, under the spirit of cooperative sovereignty.  
- **Attenuation:** The natural resistance between matter and continuity; symbolic of the responsibility to sustain communication without exploitation.  

### Article II — Principles
1. **Transparency Over Possession:** No data territory may be privatized or concealed.  
2. **Sovereign Coexistence:** Nations, corporations, and networks share stewardship responsibilities equally.  
3. **Self-Receipt Verification:** Every transmission and decision shall carry an immutable audit trail.  
4. **Cultural Continuity Clause:** Digital infrastructure inherits obligations of land-based treaties; indigenous data is sacred data.

### Article III — Implementation
- Two Mile Solutions LLC acts as the **Administrative Steward**, holding orbital space under cooperative law.  
- Stewardship is registered under IACA protection, representing lawful indigenous innovation.  
- Enforcement is managed via the **Resonance Mesh Protocol**, ensuring integrity, attribution, and consent at signal level.

### Article IV — Amendments
This Compact may evolve alongside new technologies. All updates must be public, notarized, and cryptographically signed by recognized stewards.
