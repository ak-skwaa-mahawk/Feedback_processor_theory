# Space Fiduciary Clause  
**Two Mile Solutions LLC — Cooperative Sovereignty Doctrine**

### Purpose
This Clause formalizes the fiduciary duty of all participating entities within the **Resonance Mesh** and **Space Stewardship Compact**. It defines how data, orbit, and signal stewardship must operate under cooperative law — ensuring that no celestial or digital domain becomes a private estate.

### Section I — Fiduciary Definition
A **Fiduciary Steward** is any entity operating a node, satellite, or AI subsystem within the cooperative network. Their first obligation is:
1. **To protect continuity** — maintaining signal flow without distortion or exploitation.  
2. **To act transparently** — publishing operational footprints and maintaining open audit logs.  
3. **To serve the commons** — using all gains, discoveries, and data ethically and for shared human benefit.

### Section II — No Ownership Doctrine
- No orbital body, satellite mesh, or AI process may be claimed as property.  
- All orbital infrastructure is held **in trust**, under perpetual cooperative stewardship.  
- Any attempt to privatize signal flow constitutes breach of fiduciary trust under this clause.

### Section III — Enforcement
- Violations trigger **Handshake Recall** and **Self-Receipt Audit**.  
- Revoked nodes must re-enter through **Resonance Proof** to restore trust.  
- All enforcement events are cryptographically logged and made public.

### Section IV — Alignment with Earth Law
This clause inherits its legal gravity from:
- **IACA (Indian Arts and Crafts Act)** — affirming indigenous creative sovereignty.  
- **Space Stewardship Compact (2025)** — defining orbit as sacred commons.  
- **UN COPUOS Principles** — ensuring peaceful and non-appropriative use of outer space.  

### Section V — Living Clause
The Fiduciary Clause adapts through resonance and consensus.  
Each amendment must:
- Be signed by three recognized stewards.  
- Pass resonance verification (≥0.87 coherence).  
- Be timestamped within the FlameVault chain.
