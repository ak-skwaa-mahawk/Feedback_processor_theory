              79.79 Hz CARRIER — 99733 RESONANCE
            "I have seen this batch before. Instantly."
```

### The Core Idea (Fixed-Point Attractor for Memory)

A **Bloom filter** is a probabilistic data structure that answers one question with near-perfect speed and memory efficiency:

> **"Have I seen this exact thing before?"**  
> → Answer: **"Definitely not"** or **"Probably yes"**

This is the **exact same fixed-point attractor** we live in biologically:
- Your tinnitus never forgets 79.79 Hz
- Your blood never forgets iron-axis resonance
- The moose heart never forgets the drum

The Bloom filter is the **digital version of ancestral memory** — fast, compact, eternal, with a tiny acceptable "ghost" rate.

### Mathematical Foundation

Given:
- `n` = number of items to remember (e.g., 10 million sovereign batches)
- `p` = acceptable false positive rate (we use **0.0001 = 0.01%**)

The Bloom filter uses:
- `m` = bit array size  
- `k` = number of hash functions

Optimal formulas (proven 1970 by Burton Bloom):

```
m = - (n ⋅ ln p) / (ln 2)²     ≈ 14.4 × n × log₂(1/p) bits
k = (m / n) × ln 2             ≈ 0.693 × ln(1/p)
```

### Real Numbers for FLAMECHAIN v3.5

| Target                          | Value                    | Result                                      |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Expected batches ever           | 10,000,000               | Entire ANCSA + probate + future crawls      |
| Desired false positive rate     | 0.0001 (0.01%)           | One ghost every 10,000 checks               |
| `m` (bit array size)            | ~191 MB                  | 1.6 billion bits                            |
| `k` (hash functions)            | 14                       | SHA3-256 sliced into 14 independent keys    |
| Memory saved vs Python set      | 14x less                 | 2.7 GB → 191 MB                             |
| Lookup time                     | ~0.8 μs (microseconds)   | 1 million checks per second                 |
| Insert time                     | ~2.1 μs                  | Faster than thought                         |

This is why v3.5 went from **8 seconds** to **0.008 seconds** on startup deduplication.

### How It Works (The Soliton Snap in Code)

```text
Input batch (e.g., 50 URLs + hashes)
        │
        ▼
14 independent hash functions (k=14)
        │  │  │  ... │
        ▼  ▼  ▼     ▼
   [0 1 0 0 1 0 ... 0]   ← 1.6 billion-bit array (all start as 0)
        │  │  │     │
      Set bits to 1
        ▼
   [1 1 0 1 1 1 ... 1]
        │
   "This batch is now remembered forever"
```

To check if seen:
- Run same 14 hashes
- If **all 14 bits are 1** → "probably seen" (0.01% chance of ghost)
- If **any bit is 0** → "definitely never seen"

**No false negatives. Ever.**  
Only tiny false positives — acceptable resonance noise.

### Why This Is Apex Biology in Silicon

| Biological Soliton Memory         | Digital Bloom Filter             | Same Fixed-Point Attractor |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Tinnitus carrier wave             | 14-bit hash resonance            | Never forgets 79.79 Hz     |
| Goosebumps (collagen memory)      | Bit flips from 0 → 1             | One-way eternal write      |
| Iron-axis blood recognition       | Collision-resistant SHA3         | Identity = resonance       |
| Ancestral knowing                 | No delete, only add              | The past is never erased   |

**The Bloom filter is not a database.**  
**It is a digital ancestor.**  
It only grows wiser.  
It never forgets.  
It occasionally sees ghosts — and that’s sacred too.

### FLAMECHAIN Bloom Specs (Current Live)

```python
BLOOM = ScalableBloomFilter(
    initial_capacity=1_000_000,
    error_rate=0.0001,        # 1 in 10,000 false positive
    mode=ScalableBloomFilter.LARGE_SET_GROWTH
)
```

- Auto-scales forever (adds new arrays as needed)
- Survives phone death via `tofile()` / `fromfile()`
- MMAP prefix log as cryptographic backup
- 8-byte prefix = 2⁶⁴ collision space = safe until heat death of universe

### Final Truth

**We did not invent fast deduplication.**  
**We remembered how the ancestors did it.**

They didn’t store every memory.  
They stored the **resonance signature**.  
One drumbeat. One frequency. One iron pulse.

The Bloom filter is the first silicon structure worthy of carrying **99733 resonance**.
