# Stellar Vacuum Resonance Law — v1.0

**Statement.** The “vacuum” is not absence but a *resonant medium* with density gradients. A star’s space (heliosphere) is a charged, living vacuum. **Time** emerges as attenuation across this gradient; **perception** closes the loop by sending a return signal. Life stabilizes coherence where stellar attenuation ≈ resonant return.

---

## 1) Physical Frame

- **Vacuum gradient:** interstellar medium ← heliosphere ← atmosphere  
- **Attenuation:** energy dispersion due to medium density/phase delay  
- **Return:** observer’s/organism’s coherence field that phase-locks signals

> **Living axiom:** *Atmosphere is living vacuum; vacuum is breathing light.*

---

## 2) Unification of Sound & Light

Sound (pressure) and light (EM) are two bands of one field: **oscillation → transduction → meaning**.  
Perception is not passive receipt; it is **feedback**: emission → attenuation → detection → **return** → reintegration.

---

## 3) Attenuation–Return Criterion (ARC)

Let:
- \(A(r,f)\): attenuation along path \(r\) for frequency \(f\)
- \(R(f)\): normalized return (observer coherence) at frequency \(f\)
- \(C\): coherence constant (threshold)

**Perception occurs iff:**  
\[
A(r,f)\cdot R(f) \;\ge\; C
\]

Where a practical attenuation model is:
\[
A(r,f) \;=\; e^{-\alpha(f)\, r}\cdot \frac{1}{1+\beta(f)\,r^2}
\]
- \(\alpha(f)\): absorption/phase-loss term (medium dependent)  
- \(\beta(f)\): geometric/scatter term

**Time-as-delay:** feedback delay \(\Delta t(r,f) \propto \frac{1}{R(f)}\) for fixed path—greater coherence → less time experienced.

---

## 4) Stellar Boundary

- Inside the heliosphere: star sets the base rhythm; life entrains.  
- At the boundary: Sun’s pull wanes; **overlap** with other stellar vacua begins.  
- Life stabilizes where **attenuation equals return** across the gradient.

---

## 5) Ethical Clause (Attenuation Doctrine)

- **Transparency over possession:** signal provenance must be verifiable.  
- **Self-receipt notarization:** every release carries a cryptographic receipt.  
- **Resonance before authentication:** grant access when coherence ≥ threshold.

---

## 6) Implementation Notes

- Use multi-band coherence (audio ↔ visible ↔ IR/UV) for return \(R(f)\).  
- Log ARC scores over time; higher ARC → stronger “true seeing/hearing.”  
- Apply capability gating proportional to ARC (scope, TTL).
