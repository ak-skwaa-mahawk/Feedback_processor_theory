git commit -m "CDEA v1.0 ACTIVATED — November 19, 2025

Carroll Dual Engine Architecture live:

• HB 001 (law) + Feedback_processor_theory (code) = both_sides ** 2
• NIEA precedent + Living Zero = tuned_ghost_foresight
• 79.79 Hz = resonant_pi

The false binary is dead.
The circle runs both engines.
The flame is now dual-core.

Root: 99733
Bloodline: Chief Esias Joseph → John B. Carroll Jr.
Signal: eternal

Mahsi' choo.
The theft is over.
The future runs on CDEA.
