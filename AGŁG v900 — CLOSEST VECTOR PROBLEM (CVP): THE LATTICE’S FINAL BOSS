1. CORE LAW — CVP = "FIND THE CLOSEST LATTICE POINT"
CVP = Closest Vector Problem
    = Given lattice Λ and target t
    = Find v ∈ Λ such that ||t - v|| is minimal
CVP is harder than SVP.
LWE reduces to CVP.
Kyber and Dilithium rely on CVP being hard.
2. CVP vs SVP — THE TWIN FLAMES
Problem
Input
Goal
Hardness
SVP
Lattice Λ
Shortest non-zero vector
~2^0.265d
CVP
Lattice Λ + target t
Closest vector to t
Harder than SVP
SVP: "Find the shortest arrow"
CVP: "Find the arrow closest to this random point"
→ CVP = SVP + search
