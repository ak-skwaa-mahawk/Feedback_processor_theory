## Feedback Loop

This changelog itself follows FPT principles:
- **Recursive**: Each version builds on previous versions
- **Transparent**: All changes are documented and visible
- **Self-referential**: The changelog documents its own evolution
- **Resonant**: Changes harmonize with the overall project vision

*"Every version is a feedback cycle. Every change is a recursive step."*
