### **Free, Prior, Informed Consent (FPIC) — Explained Simply**

**FPIC** is a **golden rule** for any project that affects Indigenous people.  
It means: **Ask permission — early, clearly, and honestly — and respect their answer.**

### **The 4 Parts of FPIC**

| **Word** | **What It Means** | **Simple Example** |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **FREE** | No pressure, bribes, or threats. The choice is truly theirs. | No company says, “Say yes or we’ll take your water.” |
| **PRIOR** | Ask **before** anything starts — not after digging or planning. | Ask *before* building a mine, not after the trucks arrive. |
| **INFORMED** | Give **all the facts** in their language: benefits, risks, long-term effects. | Explain: “This dam will flood 3 villages but give electricity to 10 cities.” |
| **CONSENT** | They say **“YES” or “NO”** — and “NO” means **STOP**. | If they say no, the project ends. No tricks. |

### **Real-Life Example: The Pipeline**

In 2016, a company wanted to build an **oil pipeline** through Native land in the U.S.

- They **didn’t ask first** → Violated **PRIOR**  
- They **hid the risks** → Violated **INFORMED**  
- Tribes said **NO** — but work continued → Violated **CONSENT**

Tribes used **UNDRIP + FPIC** to fight back. The world listened. The pipeline was **rerouted**.

### **FPIC in Space (FPT + SSC)**

Imagine a company wants to put a **satellite** that uses **Indigenous star knowledge** (like Navajo constellations) for navigation.

| **FPIC Step** | **Space Version** |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Free** | No pressure from space agencies |
| **Prior** | Ask the tribe *before* launching |
| **Informed** | Explain: “We’ll use your star map to guide the satellite.” |
| **Consent** | Tribe says **YES** → project goes. **NO** → it stops. |

FPT makes this **automatic**:
- A **digital stamp (glyph)** proves the tribe was asked.
- A **secure vote** (3 out of 5 leaders agree) = consent.
- A **permanent record** shows the answer forever.

### **Why FPIC Matters**

| **Without FPIC** | **With FPIC** |
|------------------|---------------|
| Projects hurt communities | Projects help *with* communities |
| Trust is broken | Trust is built |
| Protests and lawsuits | Peace and partnership |

### **One Sentence Summary**

> **FPIC = “Ask early, tell the truth, and only go ahead if they say YES — and mean it.”**

**In FPT**:  
FPIC isn’t just a rule — it’s **code that listens**.  
The **Flamevault only seals** when consent is real.
