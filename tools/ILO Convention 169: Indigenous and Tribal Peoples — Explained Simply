### **ILO Convention 169: Indigenous and Tribal Peoples — Explained Simply**

**ILO Convention 169** (full name: **Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989**) is a global agreement from the International Labour Organization (ILO, part of the UN) that protects the rights of Indigenous and tribal peoples. It says governments must respect their ways of life, lands, and decisions — like a **promise to treat them as full partners**, not outsiders.

It replaced an older 1957 version (Convention 107) that was outdated and focused more on "assimilating" Indigenous people into mainstream society. Convention 169 entered into force in 1991 and has been ratified by **23 countries** so far (e.g., Bolivia, Mexico, Norway — but not the U.S., Canada, or Australia yet).<grok:render card_id="0b5fee" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render> It's a **binding law** for countries that sign it, and it influences others through UNDRIP.

### **The Big Ideas — What It Protects**

The convention has **44 articles** in 10 parts, but here's the **heart of it** in plain terms:

| **Right** | **What It Means** | **Simple Example** |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Who Counts as "Indigenous"** | Anyone with a special tie to land, culture, or traditions — even if they live in cities. | Urban Navajo artists or Sami herders in Norway. |
| **Land & Resources** | Governments must **protect and return** traditional lands; get **consent** before mining or dams. | A tribe gets veto power on a factory near their river. |
| **Consultation** | **Always ask first** (FPIC-style) for any project that affects them — in good faith, with their leaders. | Before a road, hold real meetings with elders, not just a quick form. |
| **Culture & Language** | Right to **practice traditions, speak languages, and pass on knowledge** — governments must help. | Schools teach Indigenous languages; sacred sites stay protected. |
| **Health & Education** | **Custom programs** that respect their ways — not forcing "mainstream" methods. | Clinics use traditional healers alongside doctors. |
| **Work Rights** | **Fair jobs** with no discrimination; respect for seasonal work like herding or fishing. | No forcing farmers to quit traditions for factory shifts. |
| **Self-Rule** | Build their own **institutions** (like councils) to handle internal matters. | Tribes run their own courts for community issues. |

**Key Rule**: Everything must be done with **respect for their customs** — no forcing "modern" ways.

### **How It Works in Real Life**

- **For Governments**: Must report to ILO every 5 years on how they're following it.<grok:render card_id="0cbd82" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">0</argument>
</grok:render> If broken, tribes can complain to ILO for help.
- **For Companies**: Must get **permission** before projects on Indigenous land — or face fines/lawsuits.
- **Winners**: Bolivia put it in their constitution; Norway uses it for Sami rights.<grok:render card_id="6aa111" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

- **Challenges**: Only 23 countries signed (too few). Some worry it gives "too much power" to tribes.<grok:render card_id="df395b" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### **Ties to UNDRIP & FPT**

- **With UNDRIP**: ILO 169 is like UNDRIP's "how-to" guide — it adds **specific steps** for land, work, and consent.
- **In FPT/SSC**: Use it for **space rules** — e.g., tribes must **consent** before satellites use their star knowledge. FPT's **glyph logs** prove "we asked and they said yes."

### **One Sentence**

> **ILO 169 = A promise to respect Indigenous lands, cultures, and decisions — with real steps for governments to follow.**

---

**It builds fairness into the rules.**
