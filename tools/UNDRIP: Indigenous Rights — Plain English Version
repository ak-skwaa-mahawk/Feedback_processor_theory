### **UNDRIP: Indigenous Rights — Plain English Version**

The **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)** is a global agreement from 2007 that says **Indigenous people have the same rights as everyone else — plus extra protections for their land, culture, and way of life**.

Think of it like a **promise from the world** to treat Indigenous communities fairly.

### **The Big Ideas (No Jargon)**

| **Right** | **What It Means** | **Real-Life Example** |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Self-Rule** | Indigenous people can make their own decisions about their communities. | Inuit in Canada run their own government in Nunavut. |
| **Land & Resources** | They own and control their traditional lands. No one can take it or use it without **asking permission first**. | Tribes in the U.S. stopped a pipeline because they weren’t asked. |
| **Culture & Language** | They can speak their language, practice traditions, and protect their stories and art. | Māori in New Zealand teach their language in schools. |
| **Say in Decisions** | Governments must **talk to them** before making laws or projects that affect them. | Sami people in Norway vote on Arctic mining plans. |
| **Treaties** | Old agreements between tribes and governments must be honored. | A U.S. court in 2020 said Oklahoma still belongs to Native tribes because of a 150-year-old treaty. |

### **How It Works in Real Life**

- **Canada**: Made UNDRIP part of its laws in 2021.
- **Bolivia**: Put it in their constitution.
- **U.S.**: Uses it to guide policy, but it’s not official law yet.
- **New Zealand**: Helps Māori get more say in local government.

### **UNDRIP in Space (FPT + Space Stewardship)**

The **Space Stewardship Compact (SSC)** uses UNDRIP to say:

> **"Space belongs to Indigenous people too — if they’ve always used the stars."**

| **UNDRIP Idea** | **Space Version** |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| You own your land | Tribes can claim rights to **satellite paths** or **lunar sites** tied to their stories |
| Ask permission | No company can use Indigenous star knowledge without **consent** |
| Protect culture | Native star maps in satellites must stay **private and respected** |

### **FPT Makes It Real (Simple Tech)**

FPT turns UNDRIP into **working tools**:

| **Tech** | **What It Does** |
|--------|------------------|
| **Glyphs** | Digital "stamps" that prove something is **truly Indigenous-made** |
| **Secure Messages** | Only the right people can read or change data |
| **Group Voting** | 3 out of 5 leaders must agree to approve a project |
| **Permanent Records** | A log that can’t be erased — like a digital treaty |

---

### **Bottom Line**

**UNDRIP says**:  
> “Indigenous people have rights — to their land, culture, and future.”

**FPT adds**:  
> “We can prove it, protect it, and take it to the stars — with math and code.”

**No jargon. Just fairness.**  
**From Earth to orbit — the right to belong.**
