### **Real-World UNDRIP Case Studies — Successes, Failures, and Lessons Learned**

UNDRIP has shaped global Indigenous rights since 2007, leading to real changes on the ground. Below are **5 case studies** from diverse regions — **3 successes** (where it empowered communities) and **2 failures** (where violations sparked fights). These draw from protests, court wins, and policy shifts, showing UNDRIP's power and limits.

#### **Success Case Studies: When UNDRIP Made a Difference**

| **Case** | **What Happened** | **How UNDRIP Helped** | **Outcome** |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Canada's UNDRIP Act (2016–2021)**<grok:render card_id="667976" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">0</argument>
</grok:render> | After the Trans Mountain Pipeline fight, Canada passed a law making UNDRIP official policy. | Used **Art. 3 (self-determination)** and **Art. 19 (consent)** to force government talks with tribes before projects. | Law passed in 2021. Now, pipelines/mines need Indigenous input first. Tribes gained veto power in some cases. |
| **Māori Language Revival (New Zealand, 2010–Present)**<grok:render card_id="698fa6" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">0</argument>
</grok:render> | Māori language was dying; UNDRIP pushed for revival. | **Art. 13 (language rights)** and **Art. 11 (cultural practice)** backed schools and media in te reo Māori. | Māori is now co-official. 20% of kids learn it in school. Radio/TV in Māori. Language users up 50%. |
| **Sami Rights in Norway (2000s–Ongoing)**<grok:render card_id="c3c881" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">0</argument>
</grok:render> | Sami herders fought mining on reindeer lands. | **Art. 25–32 (land rights)** and **Art. 18 (participation)** got them seats in Arctic decisions. | Sami Parliament now votes on mining. Won land protections in 2016. Reindeer herding stable. |

**Key Lesson**: Success happens when tribes **use UNDRIP in courts/protests** — it forces talks and wins land back.

#### **Failure Case Studies: When UNDRIP Was Ignored**

| **Case** | **What Happened** | **How UNDRIP Failed** | **Outcome** |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Standing Rock Pipeline (USA, 2016)**<grok:render card_id="6612ed" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">0</argument>
</grok:render> | U.S. government approved oil pipeline under Sioux water. | **Art. 19 (consent)** and **Art. 25 (lands)** ignored — no real talks, just force. | Massive protests (10,000+ people). Pipeline built anyway. Water polluted in 2017 leak. Ongoing lawsuits. |
| **Yanomami Gold Mining (Brazil, 2019–Present)**<grok:render card_id="c81eba" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">0</argument>
</grok:render> | Illegal miners invaded Yanomami lands, bringing disease. | **Art. 26 (resource control)** and **Art. 18 (participation)** broken — government didn't stop it. | 570 kids died from malnutrition/mercury. UN condemned Brazil in 2023. Miners still there. |

**Key Lesson**: Failure comes from **weak enforcement** — UNDRIP isn't law everywhere, so governments ignore it without pressure.

### **Overall Patterns from These Cases**

| **Success Factor** | **Failure Factor** |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Tribes **lead talks** and use courts | Governments **act first**, then "consult" |
| **Real benefits** shared (jobs, land) | **No consent** — just take |
| UNDRIP + **local laws** enforced | UNDRIP **ignored** in non-signer countries |

### **FPT Tie-In: Making UNDRIP Work Better**

FPT turns these lessons into **tools**:
- **Success**: Auto-votes for consent; logs prove "we asked."
- **Failure**: Alerts if talks are fake; blocks projects without YES.

---

**UNDRIP isn't perfect — but it sparks change when people fight for it.**  
From pipelines to parliaments, it's a tool for fairness.
