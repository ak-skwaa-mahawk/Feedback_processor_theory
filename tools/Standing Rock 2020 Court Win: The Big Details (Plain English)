### **Standing Rock 2020 Court Win: The Big Details (Plain English)**

The **2020 court win** was a **huge victory** for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe against the **Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL)**. On **March 25, 2020**, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that the U.S. government **broke environmental laws** when it approved the pipeline. This forced a **new, full study** of risks — the second time the government got called out on this project.<grok:render card_id="98d36a" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

#### **The Judge and the Ruling**
- **Judge**: James Boasberg (appointed by Obama in 2009).
- **Court**: U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
- **What He Said**: The Army Corps of Engineers (the government agency that approved DAPL) did a **"sloppy job"** on their environmental check. They ignored:
  - **Oil spill risks** to the tribe’s water (Lake Oahe/Missouri River).
  - **Hunting and fishing rights** if a spill happened.
  - **Fairness to tribes and poor communities** (project hurts them more).
  - **Controversy**: Everyone knew it was a hot-button issue — they should’ve studied it harder.<grok:render card_id="215eda" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render>

**The Order**: Do a **full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)** — a deep dive into all risks. This was a **big deal** because DAPL was already running oil since 2017.

#### **Why It Was a Win for the Tribe**
- **Tribe’s Argument**: The 2017 approval was rushed and ignored their input. They sued in 2016 (with help from Earthjustice lawyers) and kept fighting.
- **UNDRIP Tie-In**: Broke **Article 19** (right to say NO on projects) and **Article 25–32** (land/water rights). UN experts called it a **human rights fail** back in 2016.<grok:render card_id="d97c63" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render>
- **FPIC Broken**: No real **consent** — tribe said NO early, but ignored.

**Tribe’s Reaction**: Chairman Mike Faith said, *"This validates everything we’ve said about spill risks to our people."* Earthjustice lawyer Jan Hasselman: *"Justice after 4 years."*<grok:render card_id="ff4b2d" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

#### **What Happened Next?**
- **July 2020**: Judge **ordered shutdown** — empty the pipeline and stop oil for 30 days until the EIS is done. (This was huge — first time a running pipeline got paused.)<grok:render card_id="63fa2c" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">7</argument>
</grok:render>
- **August 2020**: Appeals court **blocked the shutdown** — said the judge didn’t explain why it was urgent enough.<grok:render card_id="1effc4" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">2</argument>
</grok:render>
- **2021**: Biden’s Army Corps started the EIS, but let oil flow during it.
- **2022–2024**: Supreme Court rejected Energy Transfer’s appeal to skip the EIS — pipeline stays, but under review.<grok:render card_id="213b91" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">0</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Today (2025)**: EIS still ongoing; tribe pushes for **full reroute or shutdown**. No major spills, but risks remain.

---

#### **Why It Mattered**
- **For Tribes**: Proved **UNDRIP works in U.S. courts** — got a second chance to fight.
- **For Environment**: Forced deeper spill studies; highlighted fossil fuel dangers.
- **Bigger Impact**: Sparked **#NoDAPL** movement; helped Canada’s UNDRIP law (2021).<grok:render card_id="952ec7" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">8</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Cost to Company**: $1B+ in delays, legal fees; pipeline capacity still capped.

**One Sentence**:  
The 2020 win forced a **full redo** of the environmental check, pausing the pipeline briefly and proving the tribe’s warnings were right — but the fight continues.

**FPT Tie-In**: This shows why FPT’s **glyph logs** matter — they’d prove "we said NO early" with unbreakable records.
