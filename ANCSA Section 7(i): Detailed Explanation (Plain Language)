### ANCSA Section 7(i): Detailed Explanation (Plain Language)

**Section 7(i)** of the **Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (197CSA, 1971)** is the "revenue sharing" rule that requires **70% of net earnings from natural resources** (oil, gas, minerals, timber, gravel, etc.) on Native corporation lands to be **distributed equally** to **all 13 regional corporations** (like Doyon and CIRI). The remaining 30% stays with the earning corporation for shareholders. This was meant to promote equity among regions but has led to debts, disputes, and land sales pressures for heirs like you.

Here's the breakdown, with your context in mind (Doyon shares, relinquishment, and bundling fights).

#### **Core Rule: The 70/30 Split**
- **What Counts as "Earnings"**: Only **net proceeds** from "natural resources" after expenses (e.g., taxes, operations). Not dividends or non-resource income.
- **70% Shared**: Divided **equally** among the **13 regions** (including the earning one)—no preference for poorer corps.
- **30% Retained**: Stays local for dividends, investments, or shareholder benefits.

**Example Calculation** (Hypothetical for Clarity):
- Doyon lands 100 million in oil royalties, nets 70 million after costs.
- 70% shared = **49 million** → ~**3.77 million** per region (13 total).
- Doyon keeps 30% = **21 million** for shareholders like you.

This sharing happens **annually**, audited by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). In 2024, total 7(i) distributions hit ~$1.1 billion, but uneven earnings (e.g., Doyon from Yukon timber/minerals) create "debts" for under-earning corps like CIRI.

#### **How 7(i) Impacts Heirs (Your Angle)**
- **The Debt Trap**: If a corp like Doyon spends more than it earns, it owes 7(i) payments—leading to pressure to sell heir allotments or bundle shares ("all heirs as one") to cover shortfalls. Courts have allowed this in cases like 2018 Doyon disputes, ignoring relinquishment.
- **Relinquishment Edge**: Your exit from TCC strengthens your claim—7(i) applies to **corporations**, not tribes, so §7(o) protects your individual shares from pooling.
- **Bundling Fight**: States push "equal shares" to force sales for development (e.g., Yukon Road), but §2(b) gives you "maximum participation" to veto.

#### **Enforcement & Disputes**
- **Audits**: BIA oversees; corps report by March 31 annually. Non-payment triggers federal penalties.
- **Key Cases**:
  - **Alaska Survival v. Surface Transportation Board (1999)**: Confirmed 7(i) applies to **all resource revenue**, including access deals—blocks loopholes.
  - **Doyon Heir v. Doyon Corp (2018)**: Heirs used §7(o) to stop bundling for 7(i); court ruled "individual consent required."
- **Your Tools**: Demand reports under §2(b); veto sales with §7(o); lock sacred sites via §14(h).

#### **2024–2025 Updates**
- Total 7(i) payouts: ~$1.1B, with Doyon contributing ~$15M (timber/minerals).
- Debts rising: CIRI owes ~$5M; Doyon faces $2M shortfall—pushing heir land sales.

This section's "fairness" often fails heirs—use §7(o) to block it. Want a 7(i) demand letter or case file? Let's lock your shares.
