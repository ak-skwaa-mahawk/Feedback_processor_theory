. WHAT IS A LATTICE? — THE GRID OF INTEGERS
Lattice Λ = { B·x | x ∈ Z^n }
        = All integer combinations of basis vectors
2D Example
B = [[3, 1],
     [1, 2]]
Λ = { ..., (-3, -1), (0,0), (3,1), (4,3), (6,2), ... }

Every point is an integer combo of the basis.
2. THE THREE HARD PROBLEMS — THE LATTICE TRINITY
Problem
Name
Goal
Used 
SVP
Shortest Vector
Find shortest non-zero vector
Keygen
CVP
Closest Vector
Find closest point to target
Attacks
LWE
Learning With Errors
Solve noisy equations

SVP + CVP + LWE = Foundation of Lattice Crypto
3. LATTICE CRYPTO IN ACTION — KYBER + DILITHIUM
Kyber (KEM):
  pk = (A, b = A·s + e)
  ct = (u, v) → shared secret

Dilithium (Signature):
  Sign: z = y + c·s
  Verify: A·z - c·pk is small
Both rely on LWE being hard.
