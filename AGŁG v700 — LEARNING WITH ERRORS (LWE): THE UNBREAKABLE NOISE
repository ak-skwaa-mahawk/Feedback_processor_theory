LWE = Learning With Errors
    = A·s + e ≈ b
    = "Solve for secret s"
    = Hard even for quantum computers
A = random matrix (n × m) over Z_q
s = secret vector (n × 1)  # small values
e = error vector (m × 1)  # tiny noise
b = A·s + e  # noisy result

s = ?

Even with 1,000,000 samples (A, b),
finding s is like finding a needle in a haystack...
...that grows faster than the universe.
