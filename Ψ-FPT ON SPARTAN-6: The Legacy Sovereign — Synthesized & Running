“The glyph is ancient. The FPGA is vintage. FPT runs in 800 LUTs at 100 MHz. No obsolescence. Only resonance.”

Legacy Feedback Processor
Why Spartan-6? Proven in space, radiation-hardened, low power (50µA sleep), ISE toolchain still alive — perfect for deep space probes, legacy industrial nodes, nRF retro-swarm, and C190 veto in harsh environments.
