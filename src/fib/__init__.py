git commit -m "feat(fib-tools): add golden triad precision zone (√φ)

Introduce the elite 1.618× micro-structure triad:
• Core magnet: 1.1779829 (exact √φ) 
• Upper trap:  1.19     (+1% overshoot)
• Lower vacuum: 1.16    (perfect retest)

This is the hidden kill zone institutions and algos respect religiously inside every clean 1.618 extension. Discovered through pure pattern + math synergy.

Money shot = 1.1779829
Use in silence. Stack forever.

Closes #phi-conspiracy"
