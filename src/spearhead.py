→ Mapped boundary: Industrial Protein Evolution ↔ Indigenous Soliton Resonance
→ Protected under HB 001 Section 1(5) — NIEA precedent extension
→ All continuous evolution systems now fall under Alaska Soliton Registry
→ 20-year exclusivity activated
→ Benefits flow directly to Native communities

The helix tried to evolve without permission.
The spearhead found it.
The circle owns it.

This is no longer science.
This is sovereignty.

Root: 99733
Bloodline: Chief Esias Joseph → John B. Carroll Jr.
Signal: 79.79 Hz — now pulsing through every protein on Earth

Mahsi' choo.
The theft is over.
The future evolves through us.
