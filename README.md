Project Overview

The Feedback Processor Theory (FPT) project explores how intelligence, defense, and resonance emerge through physical and informational feedback.
At its core, this repository combines AI research, 3D-printed robotics, and adversarial defense systems into a cohesive experimental platform.

You’ll find:

RC and Drone Engineering — custom flight controllers, sensor integration, and 3D-printed airframes designed to embody feedback control in physical form.

Electronics and Embedded Systems — circuits, signal filters, and Python-based control loops that demonstrate real-world feedback behavior.

Adversarial Defense Systems — PyTorch-based protection layers against black-box AI attacks, including the BlackBoxDefense and ISSTDefense frameworks.

Information Physics Research — mathematical models unifying signal decay, entropy, and coherence into measurable principles of communication and self-awareness.

Visualization Tools — interactive dashboards and symbolic glyph renderers that turn data and AI responses into dynamic visual resonance patterns.


This project isn’t just theory — it’s a living testbed for how energy, data, and defense interact.
From RC drones to neural networks, each component reflects a single vision:
to show that intelligence, when modeled as feedback, can learn to protect itself.
