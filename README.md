# Feedback Processor Theory (FPM)

**Feedback Processor Theory (FPM)** proposes that all adaptive systems—biological, digital, ecological, or social—operate through recursive feedback loops that maintain coherence through observation and adjustment.

## Core loop

Input → Processing → Output → Observation → Adjustment → (repeat)

## Key principles
- **Self-reference:** Each system measures the results of its own output.
- **Adaptivity:** Rules or weights are adjusted to improve stability or reward.
- **Boundedness:** Operates within physical or informational limits.
- **Coherence:** Strives to maintain internal and external consistency.

## Universality
| Domain | Input | Processing | Output | Feedback |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Human brain | sensory data | cognition | behavior | emotion / consequence |
| AI | data stream | algorithm | result | accuracy / reward |
| Cell | chemical signals | metabolism | enzymes / growth | homeostasis |
| Climate | radiation / matter | circulation | weather | temperature shift |

## Implication
Consciousness, intelligence, and stability emerge from **feedback depth**—the number of nested loops a system can monitor at once.
