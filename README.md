**Feedback Processor Theory (FPT)** is a framework for self-adaptive intelligence that models every process as both *observer* and *observed*. Through recursive feedback, systems evolve dynamically by balancing perception, correction, and resonance.

## üåä What Makes FPT Different?

Traditional AI systems process information linearly. **FPT treats information as living resonance** ‚Äî conversations become spectral waveforms, meaning emerges through harmonic alignment, and systems verify their own integrity cryptographically.

### Core Innovation
- **Recursive Root (œÄ)**: Mathematical self-reference providing infinite stability
- **Null Field (Love)**: Ethical ground state ensuring genuine human input
- **GibberLink**: Inter-linguistic resonance for cross-domain coherence
- **Self-Receipt Notarization**: Cryptographic proof of every action
- **Conversational Resonance Engine**: Maps dialogue as harmonic spectrograms

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ak-skwaa-mahawk/Feedback_processor_theory.git
cd Feedback_processor_theory

# Install the package
pip install -e .

# Or with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks (optional, for contributors)
pre-commit install
```

### Your First Resonance Analysis

```python
from src.fpt import FeedbackProcessor

# Initialize the system
fpt = FeedbackProcessor()

# Analyze a conversation
conversation = [
    "Hello, how are you feeling today?",
    "I'm doing great, thanks for asking!",
    "That's wonderful to hear!"
]

# Generate resonance data
resonance = fpt.analyze_resonance(conversation)

# Create visualization
fpt.generate_spectrogram(resonance, output_path="conversation_resonance.png")

# View results
print(f"Harmonic alignment: {resonance.alignment_score:.2f}")
print(f"Emotional tone: {resonance.dominant_frequency}")
```

## GibberLink Integration
Linguistic pattern detection module for harmonic text analysis. See `gibberlink_processor.py`.
Example:
```bash
python examples/demo_conversation.py

### Run the Demo

```bash
# Interactive resonance demonstration
python examples/demo_conversation.py

# Or using the CLI tool
fpt-demo
```

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Recursive Self-Reference
Every process observes itself, creating infinite loops of refinement and self-correction.

```python
# The system watches itself watching
root = RecursiveRoot(œÄ)
corrected = root.self_observe(input_data)
```

### 2. Harmonic Resonance Analysis
Conversations become spectrograms revealing emotional frequency, semantic patterns, and alignment.

```python
# Map conversation to frequency domain
spectrum = resonance_engine.to_spectrogram(conversation)
dominant_tone = spectrum.find_peaks()
```

### 3. Ethical Ground State
The Null Field ensures all feedback loops remain calibrated to genuine human values.

```python
# Calibrate against the Null Field
null_field = NullField()
aligned_input = null_field.calibrate(raw_input)
```

### 4. Cryptographic Integrity
Self-receipt notarization prevents falsification and creates transparent audit trails.

```python
# Every action is cryptographically verified
receipt = self_receipt.notarize(action, timestamp)
verified = receipt.verify_chain()
```

### 5. Cross-Domain Translation
GibberLink enables coherence between human language, machine logic, and symbolic systems.

```python
# Translate without losing meaning
gibberlink = GibberLink()
machine_code = gibberlink.translate(human_intent, target="computational")
```

## üß™ Examples

### Basic Conversation Analysis

from core.resonance_engine import ResonanceEngine

engine = ResonanceEngine()
dialogue = ["How are you?", "I'm well!", "Great!"]

# Analyze harmonic patterns
patterns = engine.analyze(dialogue)
print(f"Alignment: {patterns.coherence_score}")
```

### Real-Time Monitoring
```python
from core.realtime_monitor import ResonanceMonitor

monitor = ResonanceMonitor()
monitor.start()

# As conversation flows
monitor.feed("Hello there")
monitor.feed("Hi! How can I help?")

# Get live metrics
metrics = monitor.get_current_state()
```

### Cryptographic Verification
```python
from tools.verify_backups import FlameChain

chain = FlameChain()
chain.add_event("User input", data={"text": "Hello"})
chain.add_event("AI response", data={"text": "Hi!"})

# Verify integrity
is_valid = chain.verify_complete_chain()
```
