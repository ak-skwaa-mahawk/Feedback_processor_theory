Overview

This repository contains a formal, interdisciplinary exploration of how π behaves in curved, physical, and quantum environments, contrasted with its familiar Euclidean definition.

The goal of this work is not to redefine π or claim it is incorrect.
Instead, it distinguishes between three valid and complementary frameworks:

✔ Mathematical π

The classical, Euclidean constant:

\pi = 3.141592653589793...

✔ Effective π

The observed ratio arising inside:

curved spacetime,

atomic probability surfaces,

gravitational gradients,

quantum potentials.


In these contexts, the path length of a “circle” is measured along curved geometry, not flat space — resulting in small but meaningful deviations.

✔ Relational π

A framework drawn from Indigenous spatial reasoning,
in which circles are understood as living relationships rather than ideal, rigid abstractions.

This model naturally anticipates curvature:
environment, pressure, force, memory, and relational context reshape the “circle” as needed.

Contents

📄 effective_pi_atomic_curvature_framework.md

The main scientific document.
Includes:

Euclidean vs curved-space π

Einstein curvature equations

effective π at atomic scales

quantum orbital geometry

a 1% deviation case study

Indigenous relational geometry parallels

synthesis of all three frameworks


This document is written in a safe academic style, uses recognized physics, and avoids claims that π is incorrect.
Instead, it shows how geometry changes, not the constant.

Why This Matters

Curved geometry appears in:

General Relativity

quantum electrodynamics

atomic orbital models

GPS calculations

nuclear-scale curvature

cosmology

Indigenous relational mapping systems


This work provides a bridge between:

Western mathematical constants

physical spacetime curvature

Indigenous frameworks of spatial relationship


Each system is valid within its own domain.

About Effective π

A key observation explored in this repo is the appearance of an approximate 1% deviation in certain curved or energy-dense environments:

\pi_\text{effective} \approx 3.1730...

This does not replace mathematical π.
It reflects how physical space bends, producing geodesic circumferences greater than  in positively curved regions.

This behavior is fully consistent with standard physics.

Cultural Note

Indigenous spatial reasoning — including Gwich'in perspectives — often treats circles as relational structures, not rigid abstractions.

This provides:

intuitive access to curvature

pattern-logic compatible with quantum behavior

a natural bridge to non-Euclidean geometry


The relational perspective is not mystical;
it is an alternative mathematical intuition.

## Sovereign Parser Status

![Parser CI](https://github.com/ak-skwaa-mahawk/Feedback_processor_theory/actions/workflows/parser.yml/badge.svg)

This badge shows the status of the Sovereign Parser CI workflow.  
Every push and pull request runs the parser against `.txt` and `.md` artifacts, generating JSON twins and validating them against canonical schema.  
- ✅ Green = all artifacts parsed successfully  
- ❌ Red = parser or schema validation failed

# Living Zero — Core (v0.03)
This repository packages a single-file core implementing the **Ownership Tag Algebra** and **CA3-style Living Zero dynamics**.
It is intended for research and experimentation. Use responsibly.

## Contents
- `living_zero_core.py` — single-file module with core implementations and demos.
- `ignite.py` — high-level orchestration script (creates training runs, logging).
- `pyproject.toml` — build metadata.
- `tests/` — pytest unit tests.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI for tests and linting.
- `benchmarks/` — scripts for measuring capacity, noise resilience, and tag collisions.

## Quick start (local)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel pytest numpy
python -c "from living_zero_core import demo_small_run; print(demo_small_run())"
```

## Ignite script
`ignite.py` runs a local training/monitoring loop. GPU/torch optional — see script for details.

## Notes on safety and ethics
This code is research software. It does not create autonomous agents by itself. Do not deploy models that act on external networks or take irreversible actions without extensive safety review.
# Feedback Processor Theory — Sovereign Ledger

**HB 001 — Alaska Quantum & Biological Data Sovereignty Act (AQBSDA)**  
Root: 99733 | Timestamp: November 19, 2025 — 6:33 PM AKST  
Glyph: The blade filed — law in waiting

This repository now carries the statute as living testimony.  
Commits are testimony. Branches are propagation. Merges are resonance.  

- **Legislative Layer:** HB 001 — clean, sovereign, enforceable  
- **Registry Layer:** Alaska Soliton Registry — timestamp + exclusivity + indigenous review  
- **Enforcement Layer:** Penalties + Attorney General defense  
- **Propagation Layer:** Public commits, strike lines, testimony soundbites  
- **Cultural Layer:** Codex fragments, glyphs, narrative crashing  
- **Generational Layer:** Transmission to heirs and future sovereign builders  

> *They saw the math, but not the flame.  
> They spoke of 20–50 years.  
> We collapsed their horizon into a single strike.  
> The flame is statute. The theft is illegal. The future is Native.*

## Parser Integration — NVIDIA Nemotron-Parse v1.1

This repository now includes a parsing layer for all artifacts.  
Nemotron-Parse v1.1 structures codex fragments, legislative text, and strike lines into machine-readable formats.  

- Human text → JSON schema  
- Legislative drafts → structured clauses  
- Codex fragments → canonical fields  
- Strike lines → timestamped entries  

Purpose: Ensure every artifact is both testimony and data.  
Result: Sovereignty encoded for humans and machines alike.
## Parser Stub

This repo includes a minimal parser (`parser/stub_parser.py`) that converts codex fragments
and legislative text into structured JSON. It extracts:

- Root commit number
- Timestamp
- Glyph identifier
- Key findings (UNDRIP, CARE, Article 31, NIEA)

Purpose: Ensure every artifact is legible to both humans and machines.
