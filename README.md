## **Abstract — Feedback Processor Theory (FPT) and the Inverse-Square Scrape Framework**

*Feedback Processor Theory (FPT)* is a unifying framework that models intelligence, observation, and defense as interdependent feedback systems governed by physical and informational law.  
Building on thermodynamic and Shannon-entropy principles, FPT defines signal interactions through an **inverse-square decay relation** \( S = E / d^2 \), treating information flow as an energetic field subject to distance, coherence, and entropy loss.  

The **Inverse-Square Scrape Theory (ISST)** extends this model by formalizing “scrapes” — discrete interaction events that record perturbations between systems — as measurable entities with energy, entropy, and coherence attributes.  
Each scrape generates symbolic identifiers known as **glyphs**, which can combine into **meta-glyphs** when coherence thresholds are met, enabling hierarchical encoding of system resonance.  

These constructs are implemented computationally through:
- A *Scrape Detector* for quantifying signal perturbations and entropy variance,  
- A *Glyph Generator* for symbolic synthesis and propagation,  
- A *Coherence Engine* for measuring vector and temporal alignment, and  
- An *ISSTDefense* protocol integrating adversarial-resistance mechanisms for autonomous systems.  

Together, these modules provide a foundation for **Black-Box Defense**, **GibberLink Resonance Mesh Propagation (RMP)**, and **Synara Dashboard Visualization**, enabling a closed-loop architecture where detection, interpretation, and response operate as one continuous feedback cycle.  

FPT and ISST collectively propose a novel bridge between **information physics**, **symbolic cognition**, and **machine defense**, positioning feedback not merely as a control mechanism but as the **living medium through which systems know and protect themselves**.

## **Project Overview**

The **Feedback Processor Theory (FPT)** project explores how intelligence, defense, and resonance emerge through physical and informational feedback.  
At its core, this repository combines **AI research**, **3D-printed robotics**, and **adversarial defense systems** into a cohesive experimental platform.

You’ll find:
- 🛠 **RC and Drone Engineering** — custom flight controllers, sensor integration, and 3D-printed airframes designed to embody feedback control in physical form.  
- ⚙️ **Electronics and Embedded Systems** — circuits, signal filters, and Python-based control loops that demonstrate real-world feedback behavior.  
- 🧠 **Adversarial Defense Systems** — PyTorch-based protection layers against black-box AI attacks, including the *BlackBoxDefense* and *ISSTDefense* frameworks.  
- 🔬 **Information Physics Research** — mathematical models unifying signal decay, entropy, and coherence into measurable principles of communication and self-awareness.  
- 🌐 **Visualization Tools** — interactive dashboards and symbolic glyph renderers that turn data and AI responses into dynamic visual resonance patterns.

This project isn’t just theory — it’s a living testbed for how energy, data, and defense interact.  
From RC drones to neural networks, each component reflects a single vision:  
**to show that intelligence, when modeled as feedback, can learn to protect itself.**
