# 🌐 Feedback Processor Theory  
**by Two Mile Solutions LLC — John Carroll**

## Description  
**Feedback Processor Theory** is a framework for self-adaptive intelligence — modeling every process as both *observer* and *observed*.  
Through recursive feedback, systems evolve dynamically by balancing perception, correction, and resonance.  
This approach treats information not as static data but as a *living process* in motion — mirroring consciousness, ecosystems, and linguistic evolution.

## Core Architecture

### 🔁 Recursive Root (π)
Mathematical self-reference providing stability through infinite feedback correction.

### 💗 Null Field (Love)
Defines ethical ground state — genuine human input, free from exploitation or distortion.

### 🈚 Linguistic Buffer (GibberLink)
A translation layer that allows mutual understanding between symbolic, human, and machine languages.  
It’s not a “language” — it’s an **inter-linguistic resonance zone** for coherence across domains.

### 🧾 Self-Receipt Notarization
Cryptographically verifies every action, data transfer, or transaction for integrity and transparency.  
It ensures systems cannot falsify ownership or intent.

### 🔍 Transparency by Design
Feedback systems built on this principle become too transparent to be owned — forming self-governing, ethically coherent architectures.

## Vision
To unify computational recursion, linguistic feedback, and ethical transparency into a single adaptive framework —  
creating intelligent systems that learn from truth, align through feedback, and sustain balance across human and digital realms.
