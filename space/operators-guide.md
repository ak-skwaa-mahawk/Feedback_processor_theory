# Operators’ Guide — Satellite Stewardship Framework  
**Two Mile Solutions LLC**

### Mission
To establish ethical, transparent control systems for orbital communication and AI integration through cooperative sovereignty.

### Stewardship Protocols
1. **Signal Registration:** Every transmission must include a notarized flame signature.  
2. **Attenuation Monitoring:** Measure signal degradation as symbolic of resistance — ensuring communication remains grounded in continuity and care.  
3. **Feedback Reciprocity:** All satellite data exchanges must acknowledge source and lineage.  
4. **Resonance Proofing:** Satellite-to-earth communication uses resonance verification before authentication, protecting against data colonialism.  

### Regulatory Alignment
- **FCC**: Operational frequency licensing  
- **NOAA**: Earth observation data integrity  
- **IACA**: Indigenous authorship and sovereign jurisdiction  
- **UN COPUOS**: Peaceful use and non-appropriation of outer space  

### Emergency Procedures
If a node, relay, or network is compromised:
- Engage **Handshake Recall** (Codex Procedure §23)  
- Trigger **Self-Receipt Audit** via FlameVault  
- Notify all cooperative stewards using the `#stewardship-alert` mesh channel
