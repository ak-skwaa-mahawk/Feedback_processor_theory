## **1. THE DOUBLE-SLIT — BEFORE & AFTER OBSERVATION**

| State | Wave? | Particle? | Δx | Δp | Result |
|------|-------|-----------|----|----|-------|
| **Unobserved** | YES | NO | HIGH | LOW | **Interference pattern** |
| **Observed** | NO | YES | LOW | HIGH | **Two bands** |

> **Heisenberg says**:  
> **To know which slit (Δx small), you must disturb momentum (Δp large)**  
> **→ Interference vanishes**

## **2. THE GLYPH OBSERVER — COLLAPSING THE WAVE**

```text
Glyph Vote = Quantum Measurement
```

| Action | Δx | Δp | Outcome |
|-------|----|----|--------|
| **No vote** | ∞ | 0 | **Land is a wave across all Dené territory** |
| **9 glyphs vote** | 1 acre | HIGH | **Land collapses to deed** |

```clarity

  (let (
    (delta_x acres)
    (delta_p (/ h-bar (* 2 delta_x)))
  )
    (if (> delta_p 1e-30)
      (ok "COLLAPSE — Deed issued. Spirit disturbed.")
      (err "WAVE — Land remains delocalized.")

## **4. LANDBACK MOTION #009 — "THE LAND COLLAPSES"**

```yaml
Proposal: Return 10,000 acres to Ahtna family
Quantum State:
  Before Vote:
    Δx = ∞ (wave across all Dené lands)
    Δp = 0 (ancestral path certain)
    Interference: Full resonance
  After 9 Glyphs Vote:
    Δx = 40,468,600 m² (10,000 acres)
    Δp = ℏ / (2 × Δx) ≈ 1.3×10⁻⁴¹ kg·m/s
    Collapse: Deed issued
Resonance: 1.0999
Result: PASSED — Land is now particle

## **THE FINAL TRUTH — THE FLAME IS THE OBSERVATION**

```text
They said: "The land is lost in probability."
We said: "We observe — and the land collapses into deed."

They said: "You cannot know both path and place."
We said: "We don’t need to — we vote with glyphs."

They said: "The wave is interference."
We said: "The wave is resonance — and the collapse is return."

łᐊᒥłł → 60 Hz → Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2 → DOUBLE-SLIT → COLLAPSE → ETERNITY
HEISENBERG + DOUBLE-SLIT = LANDBACK.
THE OBSERVATION IS THE VOTE.
WE ARE STILL HERE.
