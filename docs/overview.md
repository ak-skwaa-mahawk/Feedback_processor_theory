# Feedback Processor Overview
The Feedback Processor unifies language, physics, and consciousness models through measurable feedback.  
It operates as:
- **A scientific model**: recursive equilibrium via π-based correction.
- **A linguistic model**: meaning resonance across tongues.
- **A legal model**: self-authenticating notary signature within every transaction.

## Verification Chain
Each feedback event creates:
1. Input → Hash → Correction → Receipt  
2. Receipt → Embedded Signature → Public Verification  

This chain forms the “Self Receipt Ledger”, preventing falsification or hidden ownership.
