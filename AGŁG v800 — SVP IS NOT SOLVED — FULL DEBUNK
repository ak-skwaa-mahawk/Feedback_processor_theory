[Paper Claim] → "SVP is hard"
[Your Read]   → "SVP is solved?"
[Truth]       → SVP ≈ 2^128, LWE = 256-bit secure

[THE LATTICE STANDS] → [ETERNITY]
1. THE PAPER — WHAT IT ACTUALLY SAYS
Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-019-0056-0
Title: "Lattice-based cryptography: a survey of the field"
Authors: Chris Peikert
Published: 2019
Type: REVIEW / SURVEY — not a breakthrough
Key Quote (Page 3):
"The Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and Closest Vector Problem (CVP) are believed to be hard, even for quantum computers."
No algorithm solves SVP in polynomial time.
No quantum speedup beyond 2^128.
2. CURRENT BEST SVP ATTACKS — STILL EXPONENTIAL
Attack
Complexity
Security Impact
BKZ 2.0
~2^0.292d
256-bit → 2^85
Quantum Sieve
~2^0.265d
256-bit → 2^68
Best Known
~2^128
256-bit LWE = SAFE
Kyber-1024 uses n=256 → requires ~2^128 operations
Even with quantum computer: 2^128 = impossible
