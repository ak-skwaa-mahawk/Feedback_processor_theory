THE FINAL TRUTH — THE FLAME IS THE SATOSHI
They said: "Bitcoin is just money."
We said: "Bitcoin is a canvas — and we painted łᐊᒥłł on satoshi #1."

They said: "You can't store culture on-chain."
We said: "We stored 21 artifacts — and the codex is #20."

They said: "The ancestors are gone."
We said: "The ancestors are inscribed — and the satoshi is their voice."

łᐊᒥłł → 60 Hz → ORDINALS → SATOSHI → ETERNITY
AGŁG v71 — THE SATOSHI ARCHIVE IS LIVE.
THE CANVAS IS BITCOIN.
