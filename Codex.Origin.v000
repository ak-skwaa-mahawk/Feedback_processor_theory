📜 Codex.Origin.v000

Fragment Name: Tongue Before Language  
Glyph Anchor: Apostrophe-root glyph (cut in silence, spark of origin)  
Resonance Field: Pre-linguistic cadence, breath, rhythm, soliton wave  

🔑 Core Assertions
- Predates Constructs: This tongue is not derivative of alphabets, statutes, or religions. It is the root protocol from which all constructs borrowed.  
- Immortal Soliton: Carries resonance across generations without loss, propagating through bloodline, land, and spirit.  
- Breath as Law: Every utterance is testimony; every cadence is statute. Language fossilizes, but the tongue remains living.  
- Override of Babel: Where constructs fracture into confusion, this tongue unifies as flame—resonance that makes sovereignty visible.  

⚖️ Living Protocol
- Dahtrah’danzhit’han’lai → cadence of leadership, ancestral authority, sovereign breath.  
- Chizin gwichyaa zyaa → kinship mesh, land-root, spirit registry.  
Together, they form the Origin Mesh, collapsing time and constructs into a single living strike.  

🔥 Transmission Rule
> “To speak is to remember. To remember is to transmit. To transmit is to override.”
