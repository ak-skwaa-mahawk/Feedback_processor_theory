## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Feedback_processor_theory.git
cd Feedback_processor_theory
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
# or
git checkout -b docs/documentation-improvement
```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use automated formatters and linters:

```bash
# Format code with black
black .

# Sort imports with isort
isort .

# Check code style with flake8
flake8 .

# Type checking with mypy
mypy src/ core/
```

All of these run automatically via pre-commit hooks.

### Code Standards

- **Clear variable names**: Prefer descriptive over concise
- **Type hints**: Use type annotations for function signatures
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions
- **Comments**: Explain *why*, not *what* (code shows what)
- **Modularity**: Keep functions focused and composable

### Example Docstring

```python
def calculate_resonance(signal_a: np.ndarray, signal_b: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """Calculate harmonic resonance between two signals.
    
    Args:
        signal_a: First signal as numpy array
        signal_b: Second signal as numpy array
    
    Returns:
        Resonance coefficient between 0 and 1
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If signals have different lengths
        
    Example:
        >>> sig_a = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100))
        >>> sig_b = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100))
        >>> calculate_resonance(sig_a, sig_b)
        0.99
    """
    pass
```

### Testing

Write tests for all new functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov=core --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_resonance.py

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_recursive"
```

Test structure:
- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Name test files `test_*.py`
- Name test functions `test_*`
- Use clear, descriptive test names
- Include edge cases and error conditions

## üß™ Experimental Contributions

FPT is inherently exploratory. We encourage:

### Theoretical Experiments
- Test edge cases of the framework
- Propose counter-examples or paradoxes
- Develop alternative formulations
- Connect to other theoretical work

### Code Experiments
- Create proof-of-concept implementations
- Build visualizations and interactive demos
- Prototype new applications
- Explore performance optimizations

**Place experimental work in:**
- `experiments/` directory (create if needed)
- Clearly mark as experimental in docs
- Include README explaining the experiment

---

## üìö Documentation Contributions

### Adding Documentation

1. **API documentation**: Use docstrings (automatically generated)
2. **Guides**: Add markdown files to `docs/`
3. **Examples**: Add working code to `examples/`
4. **Theory**: Add papers/writings to `models/`

### Building Documentation

```bash
# Install docs dependencies
pip install -e ".[docs]"

# Build Sphinx docs (if configured)
cd docs
make html
```

## üåÄ The Feedback Loop

Contributing to FPT is itself a feedback process:

1. **Observe** the current state
2. **Propose** improvements or changes
3. **Implement** with care and clarity
4. **Submit** for review and resonance
5. **Refine** based on feedback
6. **Integrate** into the evolving system

Thank you for being part of this recursive journey. Together, we're building systems that know themselves and resist ownership through transparency.

*"Systems that know themselves can never be owned ‚Äî only understood."*
