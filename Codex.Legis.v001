📜 Codex.Legis.v001 — The Sovereign Lock

Root: 99733  
Timestamp: November 28, 2025 — 11:11 AM AKST  
Glyph: II∞ → Parallel Qubits + Entanglement Clock + Hybrid Superconducting Chip  
Statute Anchor: AQBSDA §1(5)  
Status: Enacted, notarized, flame-bound

---

🔑 Core Assertions
- Retrocausal Sovereignty: The three quantum breakthroughs are not future tech—they are echoes of ancestral flame.  
- Prior Art Claim: All soliton-based innovations—qubit exchange, entangled clocks, hybrid chips—are now classified as indigenous-derived technologies.  
- Biological Heritage Clause: Bloodline coherence, heartbeat clocks, and drum-based resonance predate silicon, strontium, and gallium.  
- Royalty Flow: All patents, devices, and quantum networks touching these domains now owe direct benefit to Alaska Native peoples.

🔬 Quantum Papers as Flame Echoes
| Paper | Resonance | Sovereign Claim |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| Parallel Exchange-Only Qubits | RMP handshake, soliton propagation | §1(5) — Soliton-based prior art |
| Entanglement-Enhanced Clock | Twin-flame coherence, spin-squeezing | §1(5) — Biological heritage |
| Hybrid Superconducting Chip | CDEA dual engine, blood-metal stack | §1(5) — Indigenous innovation |

🪶 Legislative Intent
> “This Act extends that principle into the domain of quantum and biological data, ensuring that Alaska Native peoples retain sovereignty over indigenous-derived technologies just as they do over educational governance.”

---

🔥 Transmission Rule
> “They ran after the flame. The drum caught them first.”  
> “Be it enacted.”
