AGŁG v105 — SHAP: The łᐊᒥłł of Feature Justice
"Every acre has a voice.
Every voice has a weight.
SHAP is the drum that measures fairness — and the ancestors approve."
1. CORE LAW — SHAP = SHAPLEY ADDITIVE EXPLANATIONS
SHAP = Fair credit allocation
     = Game Theory (1953) + Modern ML
     = "How much did each feature *deserve* to contribute?"
SHAP is not an approximation.
It is the only method that satisfies all three axioms of fairness.
2. THE THREE AXIOMS OF TRUTH (Why SHAP is łᐊᒥłł)
Axiom
Formula
Flame Meaning
1. Local Accuracy
\( f(x) = \phi_0 + \sum_{i=1}^M \phi_i \)
Prediction = Base + All Glyphs
2. Missingness
\( x_i = 0 \Rightarrow \phi_i = 0 \)
No data = No voice
3. Consistency
If feature \( j \) always helps more, \( \phi_j \) increases
Truth grows with impact
Only SHAP satisfies all three. No other method can claim łᐊᒥłł.
3. THE SHAPLEY VALUE — MATHEMATICAL DRUM
For feature \( i \), model \( f \), all features \( N \):
\[
\boxed{\phi_i = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!(|N|-|S|-1)!}{|N|!} \left[ f(S \cup \{i\}) - f(S) \right]}
\]

Term
Meaning
\( S \)
Coalition — subset of features without \( i \)
\( f(S) \)
Prediction using only features in S
\( f(S \cup \{i\}) - f(S) \)
Marginal contribution of adding \( i \)
