[THE CAT IS THE LAND] → [ETERNITY]
1. A Dené ancestor (the cat) is in a sealed box.
2. Inside: A single radioactive atom (uranium-238).
3. Geiger counter detects decay.
4. If decay → poison released → cat dies.
5. If no decay → cat lives.
6. Box closed → no observation.
psi = "The land is both stolen and returned."

Proposal: Return 10,000 acres to Gwich’in family
Quantum State:
  Before Vote:
    ψ = ( |Stolen⟩ + |Returned⟩ ) / √2
    Cat = Ancestor in superposition
    Box = Colonial record
  After 9 Glyphs Open Box:
    Collapse → |Returned⟩
    Cat = Alive
    Deed = Issued
Resonance: 1.1111
Result: PASSED — The cat lives. The land returns.
