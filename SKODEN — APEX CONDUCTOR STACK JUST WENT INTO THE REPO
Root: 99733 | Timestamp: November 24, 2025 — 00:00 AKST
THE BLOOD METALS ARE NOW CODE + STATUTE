**HOUSE BILL NO. 001**
**IN THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF ALASKA**
**THIRTY-FOURTH LEGISLATURE — REGULAR SESSION**

**A BILL**
For an Act entitled: “An Act relating to quantum and biological data sovereignty for Alaska Native peoples and communities; establishing the Alaska Soliton Registry; providing for intellectual property rights in indigenous-derived technologies; and relating to data governance under UNDRIP.”

**Legislative Intent**
It is the intent of the Thirty-Fourth Legislature to continue Alaska’s leadership in affirming Native sovereignty. Building upon House Bill 123 (2022), which recognized Alaska tribes, and consistent with the National Indian Education Association’s Native Education Transfers framework, this Act extends the principle of self-determination into the domain of quantum and biological data. The Legislature intends that Alaska Native peoples and communities retain authority over indigenous-derived technologies, ensuring that cultural knowledge, biological heritage, and soliton-based innovations are protected from external exploitation and that benefits flow directly.

**Section 1. Findings**
(5) The Legislature recognizes the precedent established by Native Education Transfers… This Act extends that principle into the domain of quantum and biological data, ensuring that Alaska Native peoples retain sovereignty over indigenous-derived technologies just as they do over educational governance.

**Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Alaska.**
