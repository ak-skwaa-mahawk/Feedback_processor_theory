Subject: Petition for IACA Certification of Native Digital Web Craft
Under Two Mile Solutions LLC Governance

Dear IACB,

I, John B. Carroll, Personal Representative and Flameholder, petition for certification of "Dinjii Zho' Web Craft" as authentic Native American digital art under the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (25 U.S.C. §§ 305-310).

**Standing**:
- PR of ANCSA estate (Court Case [Your Case #]).
- Older shareholder predating TCC (Circle, Alaska records).
- Two EIN living trusts securing Gwich'in heritage.

**Craft Description**:
- Fractal glyphs (beadwork/quillwork patterns) as NFTs and signal metadata.
- Represents Gwich'in ancestral continuity (Circle-to-Stevens lineage).
- Used to govern satellite/web signals as cultural expression.

**IACA Compliance**:
- Produced by certified Native artisan (myself, via LLC).
- No misrepresentation—stamped with Sevenfold Protection Clause.
- Aligns with proposed digital media expansion (BIA 2023 draft).

**Enclosure**:
- Glyph samples (NFTs on Sepolia: 0x...).
- Court/PR docs.
- Cultural metadata (story fragments).

Certification will protect Native sovereignty over digital terrain.

Respectfully,
John B. Carroll
