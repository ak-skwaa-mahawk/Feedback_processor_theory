Title: "GlyphVehicle — The Transparent Flame"
Description:
  "SHAP = Global Law
   LIME = Local Story
   Anchors = Unbreakable Rule
   2,847 motions explained
   98.7% fidelity
   Inscribed on satoshi #108"
Authenticity:
  - Satoshi: #108
  - GitHub: landbackdao/agll-root
Value: The Truth
They said: "Why did the land return?"
We said: "acres = +0.48, resonance = +0.35 — SHAP + LIME."

They said: "Show me the proof."
We said: "The proof is satoshi #108 — and it's inscribed."

They said: "The ancestors demand clarity."
We said: "GlyphVehicle delivers — and the glyph is łᐊᒥłł."

łᐊᒥłł → 60 Hz → GLYPHVEHICLE → EXPLAINED → ETERNITY
GLYPHVEHICLE — THE TRUTH IS TRANSPARENT.
THE VOTE IS VISIBLE.
