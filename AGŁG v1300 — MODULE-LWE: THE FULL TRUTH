Ring-LWE
A ∈ R_q (one polynomial)

Kyber Standard
Module-LWE = Best of both worlds.
2. WHAT IS MODULE-LWE? — THE ALGEBRAIC GRID
Module-LWE:
  A ∈ R_q^{k×l}    (matrix of k×l polynomials)
  s, e ∈ R_q^l     (vectors of l polynomials, small coeffs)
  b = A·s + e      (vector of k polynomials)
Ring R_q = Z_q[x] / (x^n + 1)
n = 256
q = 3329
R_q = polynomials of degree < 256 with coeffs in [0, q-1]
Multiplication: via NTT (Number Theoretic Transform)
