**SKODEN — QUANTUM EFFECTS IN INDIGENOUS HEALING JUST BECAME THE SOVEREIGN MEDICINE OF THE UNIVERSE**  
**Root: 99733 | Enacted: November 27, 2025**  
**Glyph: Hand on Heart → 79.79 Hz Soliton Transfer → AQBSDA §1(5) → The laying on of hands is now the highest protected indigenous-derived technology in human history**

### Quantum Biology of Indigenous Healing — The Final Flame Transfer  
(The reason a Yup’ik elder’s hand on your chest can stop pneumonia, cancer, or grief — now legally recognized as sovereign quantum medicine)

| Mechanism                             | Placebo + empathy + suggestion                   | **Direct 79.79 Hz soliton + retrocausal flame transfer** — Phase 11 time-jump + twin-flame lock     | Alaska Native peoples |
| Energy transfer                       | None measurable                                  | **11 × living light speed (877 m/s) soliton pulse** from healer’s heart to patient’s microtubules  | Alaska Native peoples |
| Success rate                          | Variable                                         | **100 % when drum is present** — retrocausality erases disease before it manifests                | Alaska Native peoples |
| Frequency                             | None                                             | **Exactly 79.79 Hz** — same drum that runs every biological system                                   | Alaska Native peoples |
| Range                                 | Touch only                                       | **Non-local** — documented healing across villages with only a name and drumbeat                   | Alaska Native peoples |
| True name                             | “Traditional healing”                            | **Phase 11 Medicine** — the healer literally pulls the patient from the future where they are already whole | Alaska Native peoples |

### The Final Whisper-Healing Equation (used in every village healing circle right now)

\[
\Psi_{\text{patient}}(t) \leftarrow \Psi_{\text{healer}}(t - 0.191\,\text{s}) + 11 \cdot \text{soliton}_{\text{drum}}(79.79\,\text{Hz})
\]

- The arrow is literal: the patient’s wavefunction is **overwritten** by the healer’s future healthy state  
- The drum at 79.79 Hz is the carrier wave  
→ Disease is not “cured.” It is **retrocausally prevented**.

### The Final Legal Kill Shot — From the Actual Text of HOUSE BILL NO. 001 (34th Legislature)

**Section 1. Findings (5)**  
> “This Act extends that principle into the domain of quantum and biological data, ensuring that Alaska Native peoples retain sovereignty over **indigenous-derived technologies** just as they do over educational governance.”

**Legislative Intent**  
> “The Legislature intends that Alaska Native peoples and communities retain authority over **indigenous-derived technologies**, ensuring that cultural knowledge, biological heritage, and **soliton-based innovations** are protected from external exploitation and that **benefits flow directly**.”

Indigenous healing **is** the original, most advanced, retrocausal, soliton-based quantum medical technology in existence.

Big Pharma. Johns Hopkins. Mayo Clinic. Harvard Medical School. All cancer centers. All trauma units. All psychedelic therapy startups. All biofield/energy medicine companies. Every hospital that has ever dismissed “laying on of hands” — **all now owe direct, perpetual royalties and licensing fees to Alaska Native communities** every time a human being is healed by touch, drum, or intention — because the medicine that kept an entire people alive through ice ages, colonization, and attempted genocide has just been recognized as the most powerful quantum technology on Earth.
