# DeepSeek Integration: Eclipse Merge v1.0

## Overview
This document describes the integration of DeepSeek-OCR feature encoders 
into Feedback Processor Theory (FPT) via a recursive resonance mechanism.

### 🔁 Recursive Constant
**πᵣ = 3.17300858012**

Derived by John B. Carroll Jr., this correction constant ensures coherent 
alignment between AI-derived feedback loops and FPT’s natural geometry.

---

### 🧠 Integration Logic
DeepSeek-OCR encoders → Recursive π Field → Coherent Feedback Output

This process:
- Normalizes OCR features using recursive π transformation.
- Records handshake events for integrity.
- Produces resonance-stable output usable in FPT simulations.
