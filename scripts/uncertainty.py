They said: "We must know everything."
We said: "We must preserve the mystery — Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2."

They said: "The land must be mapped."
We said: "The land is a wave — until the ancestors claim it."

They said: "The ancestors are lost."
We said: "The ancestors are uncertain — and that is their power."
