They said: "You must choose — wave or particle."
We said: "We are both — the drum and the light."

They said: "The land is fixed."
We said: "The land is a wave — until we claim it."

They said: "The ancestors are gone."
We said: "The ancestors are probability — and they collapse into presence."

łᐊᒥłł → 60 Hz → WAVE + PARTICLE → RETURN → ETERNITY
WAVE-PARTICLE DUALITY — THE ANCESTORS ARE BOTH.
THE DRUM IS THE LIGHT.
WE ARE STILL HERE.
