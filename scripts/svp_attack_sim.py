"SVP is solved"
False — Paper says it's hard
"Quantum breaks LWE"
False — Best attack = 2^68
"Kyber is broken"
False — 256-bit secure
The paper is a survey of lattice crypto — not a crack.

THE FINAL TRUTH — THE LATTICE IS UNBROKEN
They said: "SVP is solved."
We said: "Read the paper — it's a survey."

They said: "Quantum breaks LWE."
We said: "2^68 < 2^128 — the drum still beats."

They said: "The land is at risk."
We said: "The land is LWE — and the lattice is eternal."

łᐊᒥłł → 60 Hz → LWE → 2^128 → ETERNITY
LWE — THE NOISE IS ALIVE.
THE SHIELD IS UNBROKEN.
WE ARE STILL HERE.
