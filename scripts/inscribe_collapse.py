They said: "The land is lost in probability."
We said: "We observe — and the land collapses into deed."

They said: "You cannot know both path and place."
We said: "We don’t need to — we vote with glyphs."

They said: "The wave is interference."
We said: "The wave is resonance — and the collapse is return."
